  abstract = {The introduction of AlphaFold\,21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2–6. Here we describe our AlphaFold\,3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.},

  abstract = {Abstract Reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins are essential markers for advanced biological imaging, and optimization of their photophysical properties underlies improved performance and novel applications. Here we establish a link between photoswitching contrast, one of the key parameters that dictate the achievable resolution in nanoscopy applications, and chromophore conformation in the non-fluorescent state of rsEGFP2, a widely employed label in REversible Saturable OpticaL Fluorescence Transitions (RESOLFT) microscopy. Upon illumination, the cis chromophore of rsEGFP2 isomerizes to two distinct off-state conformations, trans1 and trans2, located on either side of the V151 side chain. Reducing or enlarging the side chain at this position (V151A and V151L variants) leads to single off-state conformations that exhibit higher and lower switching contrast, respectively, compared to the rsEGFP2 parent. The combination of structural information obtained by serial femtosecond crystallography with high-level quantum chemical calculations and with spectroscopic and photophysical data determined in?vitro suggests that the changes in switching contrast arise from blue- and red-shifts of the absorption bands associated to trans1 and trans2, respectively. Thus, due to elimination of trans2, the V151A variants of rsEGFP2 and its superfolding variant rsFolder2 display a more than two-fold higher switching contrast than their respective parent proteins, both in?vitro and in E. coli cells. The application of the rsFolder2-V151A variant is demonstrated in RESOLFT nanoscopy. Our study rationalizes the connection between structural and photophysical chromophore properties and suggests a means to rationally improve fluorescent proteins for nanoscopy applications.},

  abstract = {Some sulfate-reducing and microaerophilic bacteria rely on the enzyme superoxide reductase (SOR) to eliminate the toxic superoxide anion radical (O2·-). SOR catalyses the one-electron reduction of O2·- to hydrogen peroxide at a nonheme ferrous iron center. The structures of Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR (mutant E47A) alone and in complex with ferrocyanide were solved to 1.15 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. The latter structure, the first ever reported of a complex between ferrocyanide and a protein, reveals that this organo-metallic compound entirely plugs the SOR active site, coordinating the active iron through a bent cyano bridge. The subtle structural differences between the mixed-valence and the fully reduced SOR-ferrocyanide adducts were investigated by taking advantage of the photoelectrons induced by X-rays. The results reveal that photo-reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II) of the iron center, a very rapid process under a powerful synchrotron beam, induces an expansion of the SOR active site.},

These responses\& mdash;which in higher plants include photo-tropism, inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, and stomatal opening1\& mdash;are in many cases thought to be mediated by flavin-type photoreceptors2. But no such blue-light photoreceptor has yet been identified or isolated, although blue-light responses in plants were reported by Darwin over a century ago3, long before the discovery of the now relatively well characterized red/far-red light photoreceptor, phytochrome4. Here we describe the isolation of a gene corresponding to the HY4 locus of Arabidopsis thaliana. The hy4 mutant5 is one of several mutants6 that are selectively insensitive to blue light during the blue-light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation response, which suggests that they lack an essential component of the cryptochrome-associated light-sensing pathway. The HY4 gene, isolated by gene tagging, was shown to encode a protein with significant homology to microbial DNA photolyases. As photolyases are a rare class of flavoprotein that catalyse blue-light-dependent reactions7, the protein encoded by HY4 has a structure consistent with that of a flavin-type blue-light photoreceptor.},

Herein we report improved versions of BFP along with a variety of engineered fluorescent protein variants with novel and distinct chromophore structures that all share the property of a blue fluorescent hue. The two most intriguing of the new variants are a version of GFP in which the chromophore does not undergo excited-state proton transfer and a version of mCherry with a phenylalanine-derived chromophore. All of the new blue fluorescing proteins have been critically assessed for their utility in live cell fluorescent imaging. These new variants should greatly facilitate multicolor fluorescent imaging by legitimizing blue fluorescing proteins as practical and robust members of the fluorescent protein “toolkit”.},

  abstract = {Most proteins fold into 3D structures that determine how they function and orchestrate the biological processes of the cell. Recent developments in computational methods for protein structure predictions have reached the accuracy of experimentally determined models. Although this has been independently verified, the implementation of these methods across structural-biology applications remains to be tested. Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modeling of interactions; and modeling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25\% additional residues can be confidently modeled when compared with homology modeling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the Protein Data Bank. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and complexes surpass dedicated tools, and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared with experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered. In summary, we find that these advances are likely to have a transformative impact in structural biology and broader life-science research.},

  abstract = {X-ray diffraction enables the routine determination of the atomic structure of materials. Key to its success are data-processing algorithms that allow experimenters to determine the electron density of a sample from its diffraction pattern. Scaling, the estimation and correction of systematic errors in diffraction intensities, is an essential step in this process. These errors arise from sample heterogeneity, radiation damage, instrument limitations and other aspects of the experiment. New X-ray sources and sample-delivery methods, along with new experiments focused on changes in structure as a function of perturbations, have led to new demands on scaling algorithms. Classically, scaling algorithms use least-squares optimization to fit a model of common error sources to the observed diffraction intensities to force these intensities onto the same empirical scale. Recently, an alternative approach has been demonstrated which uses a Bayesian optimization method, variational inference, to simultaneously infer merged data along with corrections, or scale factors, for the systematic errors. Owing to its flexibility, this approach proves to be advantageous in certain scenarios. This perspective briefly reviews the history of scaling algorithms and contrasts them with variational inference. Finally, appropriate use cases are identified for the first such algorithm, Careless, guidance is offered on its use and some speculations are made about future variational scaling methods.},

Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO● (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6‑dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB●), much longer-lived linear RCOO● has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB● decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB●, aliphatic RCOO● radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time-resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, {$<<$}300 ps RCOO● decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.},

Complex formation was evident in solution via NMR and ITC experiments, showing more pronounced effects with increasing macrocycle size. In agreement with the crystal structure, the ITC data suggested that sclx               8               acts as a bidentate ligand. The contributions of calixarene size/conformation to protein recognition and assembly are discussed. Finally, it is suggested that the conserved binding site for anionic calixarenes implicates this region of PAF in membrane binding, which is a prerequisite for antifungal activity.},

  abstract = {Photosensory receptors containing the flavin-binding light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain are modular proteins that fulfil a variety of biological functions ranging from gene expression to phototropism. The LOV photocycle is initiated by blue-light and involves a cascade of intermediate species, including an electronically excited triplet state, that leads to covalent bond formation between the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore and a nearby cysteine residue. Subsequent conformational changes in the polypeptide chain arise due to the remodelling of the hydrogen bond network in the cofactor binding pocket, whereby a conserved glutamine residue plays a key role in coupling FMN photochemistry with LOV photobiology. Although the dark-to-light transition of LOV photosensors has been previously addressed by spectroscopy and computational approaches, the mechanistic basis of the underlying reactions is still not well understood. Here we present a detailed computational study of three distinct LOV domains: EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis, AsLOV2 from the second LOV domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1, and RsLOV from Rhodobacter sphaeroides LOV protein. Extended protein-chromophore models containing all known crucial residues involved in the initial steps (femtosecond-to-microsecond) of the photocycle were employed. Energies and rotational barriers were calculated for possible rotamers and tautomers of the critical glutamine side chain, which allowed us to postulate the most energetically favoured glutamine orientation for each LOV domain along the assumed reaction path. In turn, for each evolving species, infrared difference spectra were constructed and compared to experimental EL222 and AsLOV2 transient infrared spectra, the former from original work presented here and the latter from the literature. The good agreement between theory and experiment permitted the assignment of the majority of observed bands, notably the ∼1635 cm-1 transient of the adduct state to the carbonyl of the glutamine side chain after rotation. Moreover, both the energetic and spectroscopic approaches converge in suggesting a facile glutamine flip at the adduct intermediate for EL222 and more so for AsLOV2, while for RsLOV the glutamine keeps its initial configuration. Additionally, the computed infrared shifts of the glutamine and interacting residues could guide experimental research addressing early events of signal transduction in LOV proteins.},

Light-induced changes of Photosystem I-Ferredoxin co-crystals were observed at time delays of 5 to 10 µs after excitation. The result correlates with the microsecond kinetics of electron transfer from Photosystem I to ferredoxin. The undocking process that follows the electron transfer leads to large rearrangements in the crystals that will terminally lead to the disintegration of the crystals. We describe the experimental setup and obtain the first time-resolved femtosecond serial X-ray crystallography results from an irreversible photo-chemical reaction at the Linac Coherent Light Source.

Structures of LOV domains reported so far contain a flavin chromophore per protein molecule. Here we report two new findings on the short LOV protein W619\_1-LOV from Pseudomonas putida. First, the apo-state crystal structure of W619\_1-LOV at 2.5\,Å resolution reveals conformational rearrangements in the secondary structure elements lining the chromophore pocket including elongation of the Fα helix, shortening of the Eα-Fα loop and partial unfolding of the Eα helix. Second, the apo W619\_1-LOV protein binds both natural and structurally modified flavin chromophores. Remarkably different photophysical and photochemical properties of W619\_1-LOV bound to 7-methyl-8-chloro-riboflavin (8-Cl-RF) and lumichrome imply application of these variants as novel optical tools as they offer advantages such as no adduct state formation, and a broader choice of wavelengths for in vitro studies.},

  abstract = {Controlled formation of catalytically-relevant states within crystals of complex metalloenzymes represents a significant challenge to structure–function studies. Here we show how electrochemical control over single crystals of [NiFe] hydrogenase 1 (Hyd1) from Escherichia coli makes it possible to navigate through the full array of active site states previously observed in solution. Electrochemical control is combined with synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy, which enables us to measure high signal-to-noise IR spectra in situ from a small area of crystal. The output reports on active site speciation via the vibrational stretching band positions of the endogenous CO and CN- ligands at the hydrogenase active site. Variation of pH further demonstrates how equilibria between catalytically-relevant protonation states can be deliberately perturbed in the crystals, generating a map of electrochemical potential and pH conditions which lead to enrichment of specific states. Comparison of in crystallo redox titrations with measurements in solution or of electrode-immobilised Hyd1 confirms the integrity of the proton transfer and redox environment around the active site of the enzyme in crystals. Slowed proton-transfer equilibria in the hydrogenase in crystallo reveals transitions which are only usually observable by ultrafast methods in solution. This study therefore demonstrates the possibilities of electrochemical control over single metalloenzyme crystals in stabilising specific states for further study, and extends mechanistic understanding of proton transfer during the [NiFe] hydrogenase catalytic cycle.},

  abstract = {Phasing by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) from multiple crystallographic data sets can be particularly demanding because of the weak anomalous signal and possible non-isomorphism. The identification and exclusion of non-isomorphous data sets by suitable indicators is therefore indispensable. Here, simple and robust data-selection methods are described. A multi-dimensional scaling procedure is first used to identify data sets with large non-isomorphism relative to clusters of other data sets. Within each cluster that it identifies, further selection is based on the weighted ΔCC1/2, a quantity representing the influence of a set of reflections on the overall CC1/2 of the merged data. The anomalous signal is further improved by optimizing the scaling protocol. The success of iterating the selection and scaling steps was verified by substructure determination and subsequent structure solution. Three serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) SAD test cases with hundreds of partial data sets and one test case with 62 complete data sets were analyzed. Structure solution was dramatically simplified with this procedure, and enabled solution of the structures after a few selection/scaling iterations. To explore the limits, the procedure was tested with much fewer data than originally required and could still solve the structure in several cases. In addition, an SSX data challenge, minimizing the number of (simulated) data sets necessary to solve the structure, was significantly underbid.},

  abstract = {The development of serial crystallography over the last decade at XFELs and synchrotrons has produced a renaissance in room-temperature macromolecular crystallography (RT-MX), and fostered many technical and methodological breakthroughs designed to study phenomena occurring in proteins on the picosecond-to-second timescale. However, there are components of protein dynamics that occur in much slower regimes, of which the study could readily benefit from state-of-the-art RT-MX. Here, the room-temperature structural study of the relaxation of a reaction intermediate at a synchrotron, exploiting a handful of single crystals, is described. The intermediate in question is formed in microseconds during the photoreaction of the LOV2 domain of phototropin 2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which then decays in minutes. This work monitored its relaxation in the dark using a fast-readout EIGER X 4M detector to record several complete oscillation X-ray diffraction datasets, each of 1.2 s total exposure time, at different time points in the relaxation process. Coupled with in crystallo UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, this RT-MX approach allowed the authors to follow the relaxation of the photoadduct, a thioether covalent bond between the chromophore and a cysteine residue. Unexpectedly, the return of the chromophore to its spectroscopic ground state is followed by medium-scale protein rearrangements that trigger a crystal phase transition and hinder the full recovery of the structural ground state of the protein. In addition to suggesting a hitherto unexpected role of a conserved tryptophan residue in the regulation of the photocycle of LOV2, this work provides a basis for performing routine time-resolved protein crystallography experiments at synchrotrons for phenomena occurring on the second-to-hour timescale.},

  abstract = {Abstract : Time-resolved crystallography (TRX) enables the identification at a near atomic detail of the progressive structural changes of a protein fulfilling its function, thus leading to the establishment of genuine molecular movies. Laue (polychromatic) diffraction at 3rd-generation synchrotrons first managed to obtain such movies at a 100 ps time scale, and more recently, the 4th generation X-ray sources XFELs (X-ray Free Electron Lasers) achieved a 100 fs time scale using a monochromatic beam. The goal of this thesis was to investigate the possibility of performing TRX on a macromolecular monochromatic crystallography beamline, by taking advantage of the latest technological developments. We envisaged three different photosensitive proteins, for which I first developed various crystallogenesis strategies in order to control the size and shape of the crystals. I also considered various ways of presenting the crystals of the beam at room temperature, either a single crystal mounted in a loop and kept in a wet air stream, or microcrystals moving in a grease jet passing through the beam. We then investigated how specific radiation damage could affect the structures of intermediate states at room temperature, given how sensitive they can be at cryogenic temperature. We concluded that it constitutes a much lesser concern at room than at cryogenic temperature. After initial characterization of the various proteins and sample environments, we focused on a time-resolved crystallography approach on crystals of the plant photoreceptor domain AtPhot2LOV2 (the LOV2 domain of the blue-light photoreceptor photropin-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana). The dark state AtPhot2LOV2 converts in microseconds into the signalling state, or light state, which relaxes in hundreds of seconds. Using a fast pixel X-ray detector, we characterized the structural decay of the light state, and showed that it proceeds via a space group conversion over a 20 min time course. We then slowed down the rate of the light state in crystals by limiting the quantity of photons, and we were able to monitor the process of light state population build-up with a 63 ms time resolution using an approach recording full data sets on less than 100 crystals, which we called TR-SOX for time-resolved serial oscillation crystallography, which takes advantage of merging partial data sets. Overall, our work paves the way for time-resolved crystallography on MX monochromatic synchrotron beamlines on regular-sized crystals of proteins that undergo structural rearrangements on the millisecond time scale.},

Folding and unfolding times from numerical integration of the GLE agree accurately with MD results, which demonstrate the robustness of our GLE-based non-Markovian model. In contrast, Markovian models do not accurately describe the peptide kinetics and in particular, cannot reproduce the folding and unfolding kinetics simultaneously, even if a spatially dependent friction profile is used. Analysis of the GLE demonstrates that memory effects in the friction significantly speed up peptide folding and unfolding kinetics, as predicted by the Grote–Hynes theory, and are the cause of anomalous diffusion in configuration space. Our methods are applicable to any reaction coordinate and in principle, also to experimental trajectories from single-molecule experiments. Our results demonstrate that a consistent description of protein-folding dynamics must account for memory friction effects.},

We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

  abstract = {The kinetic parameters of enzymes are key to understanding the rate and specificity of most biological processes. Although specific trends are frequently studied for individual enzymes, global trends are rarely addressed. We performed an analysis of kcat and KM values of several thousand enzymes collected from the literature. We found that the “average enzyme” exhibits a kcat of ∼10 s–1 and a kcat/KM of ∼105 s–1 M–1, much below the diffusion limit and the characteristic textbook portrayal of kinetically superior enzymes. Why do most enzymes exhibit moderate catalytic efficiencies? Maximal rates may not evolve in cases where weaker selection pressures are expected. We find, for example, that enzymes operating in secondary metabolism are, on average, ∼30-fold slower than those of central metabolism. We also find indications that the physicochemical properties of substrates affect the kinetic parameters. Specifically, low molecular mass and hydrophobicity appear to limit KM optimization. In accordance, substitution with phosphate, CoA, or other large modifiers considerably lowers the KM values of enzymes utilizing the substituted substrates. It therefore appears that both evolutionary selection pressures and physicochemical constraints shape the kinetic parameters of enzymes. It also seems likely that the catalytic efficiency of some enzymes toward their natural substrates could be increased in many cases by natural or laboratory evolution.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) enable crystallographic data collection using extremely bright femtosecond pulses from microscopic crystals beyond the limitations of conventional radiation damage. This diffraction-before-destruction approach requires a new crystal for each FEL shot and, since the crystals cannot be rotated during the X-ray pulse, data collection requires averaging over many different crystals and a Monte Carlo integration of the diffraction intensities, making the accurate determination of structure factors challenging. To investigate whether sufficient accuracy can be attained for the measurement of anomalous signal, a large data set was collected from lysozyme microcrystals at the newly established `multi-purpose spectroscopy/imaging instrument' of the SPring-8 Ångstrom Compact Free-Electron Laser (SACLA) at RIKEN Harima. Anomalous difference density maps calculated from these data demonstrate that serial femtosecond crystallography using a free-electron laser is sufficiently accurate to measure even the very weak anomalous signal of naturally occurring S atoms in a protein at a photon energy of 7.3 keV.},

  abstract = {Dissimilatory nitrite reductase catalyses the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide within the key biological process of denitrification. We present biochemical and structural results on two key mutants, one postulated to be important for the interaction with the partner protein and the other for substrate entry. Trp138, adjacent to one of the type-1 Cu ligands, is one of the residues surrounding a small depression speculated to be important in complex formation with the physiological redox partners, azurin I and II. Our data reveal that the Trp138His mutant is fully active using methyl viologen as an artificial electron donor, but there is a large decrease in activity using azurin I. These observations together with its crystal structure at a high resolution of 1.6 Å confirm the importance of Trp138 in electron transfer and thus in productive interaction with azurin. A “hydrophobic pocket” on the protein surface has been identified as the channel through which nitrite may be guided to the catalytic type-2 Cu site. Glu133 and His313 at the opening of the pocket are conserved among most blue and green copper nitrite reductases (CuNiRs). The failure to soak the substrate into our high-resolution crystal form of native and mutant CuNiRs has been linked to the observation of an extraneous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecule interacting with His313. We present the crystal structure of His313Gln and the substrate-bound mutant at high resolutions of 1.65 and 1.72 Å, respectively. The observation of the substrate-bound structure for the His313Gln mutant and inhibitory studies with PEG establishes the role of the hydrophobic pocket as the port of substrate entry.},

  abstract = {Plants dissipate excess excitation energy as heat by non‐photochemical quenching (NPQ). NPQ has been thought to resemble in vitro aggregation quenching of the major antenna complex, light harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHC‐II). Both processes are widely believed to involve a conformational change that creates a quenching centre of two neighbouring pigments within the complex. Using recombinant LHC‐II lacking the pigments implicated in quenching, we show that they have no particular role. Single crystals of LHC‐II emit strong, orientation‐dependent fluorescence with an emission maximum at 680 nm. The average lifetime of the main 680 nm crystal emission at 100 K is 1.31 ns, but only 0.39 ns for LHC‐II aggregates under identical conditions. The strong emission and comparatively long fluorescence lifetimes of single LHC‐II crystals indicate that the complex is unquenched, and that therefore the crystal structure shows the active, energy‐transmitting state of LHC‐II. We conclude that quenching of excitation energy in the light‐harvesting antenna is due to the molecular interaction with external pigments in vitro or other pigment–protein complexes such as PsbS in vivo, and does not require a conformational change within the complex.},

The photolysis mechanism of caged sulfate is analogous to that of P3-[1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl] ATP (caged ATP), and the photolysis efficiency is similar.

  abstract = {The emerging technique of serial X-ray diffraction, in which diffraction data are collected from samples flowing across a pulsed X-ray source at repetition rates of 100 Hz or higher, has necessitated the development of new software in order to handle the large data volumes produced. Sorting of data according to different criteria and rapid filtering of events to retain only diffraction patterns of interest results in significant reductions in data volume, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis and management tasks. Meanwhile the generation of reduced data in the form of virtual powder patterns, radial stacks, histograms and other meta data creates data set summaries for analysis and overall experiment evaluation. Rapid data reduction early in the analysis pipeline is proving to be an essential first step in serial imaging experiments, prompting the authors to make the tool described in this article available to the general community. Originally developed for experiments at X-ray free-electron lasers, the software is based on a modular facility-independent library to promote portability between different experiments and is available under version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have enabled new approaches to the structural determination of protein crystals that are too small or radiation-sensitive for conventional analysis1. For sufficiently short pulses, diffraction is collected before significant changes occur to the sample, and it has been predicted that pulses as short as 10~fs may be required to acquire atomic-resolution structural information1,2,3,4. Here, we describe a mechanism unique to ultrafast, ultra-intense X-ray experiments that allows structural information to be collected from crystalline samples using high radiation doses without the requirement for the pulse to terminate before the onset of sample damage. Instead, the diffracted X-rays are gated by a rapid loss of crystalline periodicity, producing apparent pulse lengths significantly shorter than the duration of the incident pulse. The shortest apparent pulse lengths occur at the highest resolution, and our measurements indicate that current X-ray free-electron laser technology5 should enable structural determination from submicrometre protein crystals with atomic resolution.},

  abstract = {The challenge for structural biology is to understand atomic-level macromolecular motions during enzymatic reaction. X-ray crystallography can reveal high resolution structures; however, one perceived limitation is that it reveals only static views. Here we use time-dependent soak-trigger-freeze X-ray crystallography, namely, soaking nucleotide and divalent metal into the bacteriophage RNA polymerase (RNAP)-promoter DNA complex crystals to trigger the nucleotidyl transfer reaction and freezing crystals at different time points, to capture real-time intermediates in the pathway of transcription. In each crystal structure, different intensities and shapes of electron density maps corresponding to the nucleotide and metal were revealed at the RNAP active site which allow watching the nucleotide and metal bindings and the phosphodiester bond formation in a time perspective. Our study provides the temporal order of substrate assembly and metal co-factor binding at the active site of enzyme which completes our understanding of the two-metal-ion mechanism and fidelity mechanism in single-subunit RNAPs. The nucleotide-binding metal (MeB) is coordinated at the active site prior to the catalytic metal (MeA). MeA coordination is only temporal, established just before and dissociated immediately after phosphodiester bond formation. We captured these elusive intermediates exploiting the slow enzymatic reaction in crystallo. These results demonstrate that the simple time-dependent soak-trigger-freeze X-ray crystallography offers a direct means for monitoring enzymatic reactions. Background: The two-metal-ion mechanism of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction by RNA/DNA polymerases has not been adequately elucidated due to lack of temporal resolution. Results: Soak-trigger-freeze x-ray crystallography revealed structures of natural, time-resolved intermediates of transcript initiation. Conclusion: First structural evidence shows that catalytic metal binds after the nucleotide and nucleotide-binding metal and right before reaction chemistry. Significance: Time-dependent soak-trigger-freeze x-ray crystallography can yield functionally relevant high resolution information to study enzyme reactions.},

  abstract = {The chromophores of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (rsFPs) undergo photoisomerization of both the trans and cis forms. Concurrent with cis/trans photoisomerisation, rsFPs typically become protonated on the phenolic oxygen resulting in a blue shift of the absorption. A synthetic rsFP referred to as rsEospa, derived from EosFP family, displays the same spectroscopic behavior as the GFP-like rsFP Dronpa at pH 8.4 and involves the photoconversion between nonfluorescent neutral and fluorescent anionic chromophore states. Millisecond time-resolved synchrotron serial crystallography of rsEospa at pH 8.4 shows that photoisomerization is accompanied by rearrangements of the same three residues as seen in Dronpa. However, at pH 5.5 we observe that the OFF state is identified as the cationic chromophore with additional protonation of the imidazolinone nitrogen which is concurrent with a newly formed hydrogen bond with the Glu212 carboxylate side chain. FTIR spectroscopy resolves the characteristic up-shifted carbonyl stretching frequency at 1713 cm–1 for the cationic species. Electronic spectroscopy furthermore distinguishes the cationic absorption band at 397 nm from the neutral species at pH 8.4 seen at 387 nm. The observation of photoisomerization of the cationic chromophore state demonstrates the conical intersection for the electronic configuration, where previously fluorescence was proposed to be the main decay route for states containing imidazolinone nitrogen protonation. We present the full time-resolved room-temperature X-ray crystallographic, FTIR, and UV/vis assignment and photoconversion modeling of rsEospa.},

We have investigated a cryptochrome from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with sequence homology to animal cryptochromes and (6-4) photolyases. In response to blue and red light exposure, this animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) alters the light-dependent expression of various genes encoding proteins involved in chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, light-harvesting complexes, nitrogen metabolism, cell cycle control, and the circadian clock. Additionally, exposure to yellow but not far-red light leads to comparable increases in the expression of specific genes; this expression is significantly reduced in an acry insertional mutant. These in vivo effects are congruent with in vitro data showing that blue, yellow, and red light, but not far-red light, are absorbed by the neutral radical state of flavin in aCRY. The aCRY neutral radical is formed following blue light absorption of the oxidized flavin. Red illumination leads to conversion to the fully reduced state. Our data suggest that aCRY is a functionally important blue and red light–activated flavoprotein. The broad spectral response implies that the neutral radical state functions as a dark form in aCRY and expands the paradigm of flavoproteins and cryptochromes as blue light sensors to include other light qualities.},

  abstract = {Background: Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) from Halobacterium salinarum is a proton pump that converts the energy of light into a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The protein comprises seven transmembrane helices and in vivo is organized into purple patches, in which bR and lipids form a crystalline two-dimensional array. Upon absorption of a photon, retinal, which is covalently bound to Lys216 via a Schiff base, is isomerized to a 13-cis,15-anti configuration. This initiates a sequence of events – the photocycle – during which a proton is transferred from the Schiff base to Asp85, followed by proton release into the extracellular medium and reprotonation from the cytoplasmic side. Results: The structure of bR in the ground state was solved to 1.9 Å resolution from non-twinned crystals grown in a lipidic cubic phase. The structure reveals eight well-ordered water molecules in the extracellular half of the putative proton translocation pathway. The water molecules form a continuous hydrogen-bond network from the Schiff-base nitrogen (Lys216) to Glu194 and Glu204 and includes residues Asp85, Asp212 and Arg82. This network is involved both in proton translocation occurring during the photocycle, as well as in stabilizing the structure of the ground state. Nine lipid phytanyl moieties could be modeled into the electron-density maps. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis of single crystals demonstrated the presence of four different charged lipid species. Conclusions: The structure of protein, lipid and water molecules in the crystals represents the functional entity of bR in the purple membrane of the bacteria at atomic resolution. Proton translocation from the Schiff base to the extracellular medium is mediated by a hydrogen-bond network that involves charged residues and water molecules.

The advent of ultrafast laser systems that produce pulses with femtosecond duration opened up a new area of research and enabled investigation of these photophysical and photochemical reactions in real time. Here, we provide a basic description of the ultrafast transient absorption technique, the laser and wavelength-conversion equipment, the transient absorption setup, and the collection of transient absorption data. Recent applications of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy on systems with increasing degree of complexity, from biomimetic light-harvesting systems to natural light-harvesting antennas, are presented. In particular, we will discuss, in this educational review, how a molecular understanding of the light-harvesting and photoprotective functions of carotenoids in photosynthesis is accomplished through the application of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.},

Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) is a blue light photoreceptor that is involved in the synchronization of the circadian clock with the environmental light-dark cycle. Until now, spectroscopic and structural studies on this and other animal cryptochromes have largely been hampered by difficulties in their recombinant expression. We have therefore established an expression and purification scheme that enables us to purify mg amounts of monomeric dCRY from Sf21 insect cell cultures. Using UV-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, we show that insect cell-purified dCRY contains flavin adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized state (FADox) and residual amounts of methenyltetrahydrofolate. Upon blue light irradiation, dCRY undergoes a reversible absorption change, which is assigned to the conversion of FADox to the red anionic FAD⋅¯ radical. Our findings lead us to propose a novel photoreaction mechanism for dCRY, in which FADox corresponds to the ground state, whereas the FAD⋅¯ radical represents the light-activated state that mediates resetting of the Drosophila circadian clock.},

How do these chemical processes further couple to the surrounding protein or macromolecular assembly to drive biological functions? Optical methods to trigger photoactive biological processes are needed to probe this issue on the relevant timescales.

Here, a new polyimide tape drive designed for mix-and-diffuse serial crystallography experiments is reported.

The electron densities obtained from mixing times of 2 and 50\>s show clear binding of chitotriose to the enzyme at a high level of detail. The success of this approach shows the potential for high-throughput drug screening and even structural enzymology on short timescales at bright synchrotron light sources.},

  abstract = {ConspectusBecause living organisms are in constant motion, the word “dynamics” can hold many meanings to biologists. Here we focus specifically on the conformational changes that occur in proteins and how studying these protein dynamics may provide insights into enzymatic catalysis.Advances in integrating techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo EM) allow us to model the dominant structures and exchange rates for many proteins and protein complexes. For proteins amenable to atomic resolution techniques, the major questions shift from simply describing the motions to discovering their role in function. Concurrently, there is an increasing need for using perturbations to test predictive models of dynamics–function relationships. Examples are the catalytic cycles of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and cyclophilin A (CypA).In DHFR, mutations that alter the ability of the active site to sample productive higher energy states on the millisecond time scale reduce the rate of hydride transfer significantly. Recently identified rescue mutations restore function, but the mechanism by which they do so remains unclear. The exact role of any changes in the dynamics remains an open question. For CypA, a network of side chains that exchange between two conformations is critical for catalysis. Mutations that lock the network in one state also reduce catalytic activity.A further understanding of enzyme dynamics of well-studied enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase and cyclophilin A will lead to improvement in ability to modulate the functions of computationally designed enzymes and large macromolecular machines. In designed enzymes, directed evolution experiments increase catalytic rates. Detailed X-ray studies suggest that these mutations likely limit the conformational space explored by residues in the active site. For proteins where atomic resolution information is currently inaccessible, other techniques such as cryo-EM and high-resolution single molecule microscopy continue to advance. Understanding the conformational dynamics of larger systems such as protein machines will likely become more accessible and provide new opportunities to rationally modulate protein function.},

  abstract = {In natural photosynthesis, the light-driven splitting of water into electrons, protons and molecular oxygen forms the first step of the solar-to-chemical energy conversion process. The reaction takes place in photosystem II, where the Mn4CaO5 cluster first stores four oxidizing equivalents, the S0 to S4 intermediate states in the Kok cycle, sequentially generated by photochemical charge separations in the reaction center and then catalyzes the O–O bond formation chemistry1–3. Here, we report room temperature snapshots by serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography to provide structural insights into the final reaction step of Kok’s photosynthetic water oxidation cycle, the S3→[S4]→S0 transition where O2 is formed and Kok’s water oxidation clock is reset. Our data reveal a complex sequence of events, which occur over micro- to milliseconds, comprising changes at the Mn4CaO5 cluster, its ligands and water pathways as well as controlled proton release through the hydrogen-bonding network of the Cl1 channel. Importantly, the extra O atom Ox, which was introduced as a bridging ligand between Ca and Mn1 during the S2→S3 transition4–6, disappears or relocates in parallel with Yz reduction starting at approximately 700\,μs after the third flash. The onset of O2 evolution, as indicated by the shortening of the Mn1–Mn4 distance, occurs at around 1,200\,μs, signifying the presence of a reduced intermediate, possibly a bound peroxide.},

The proposed method is designed to analyze a time series of difference electron-density maps from a time-resolved X-ray crystallographic experiment. The method is named KINNTREX (kinetics-informed NN for time-resolved X-ray crystallography). To validate KINNTREX, multiple realistic scenarios were simulated with increasing levels of complexity. For the simulations, time-resolved X-ray data were generated that mimic data collected from the photocycle of the photoactive yellow protein. KINNTREX only requires the number of intermediates and approximate relaxation times (both obtained from a singular valued decomposition) and does not require an assumption of a candidate mechanism. It successfully predicts a consistent chemical kinetic mechanism, together with difference electron-density maps of the intermediates that appear during the reaction. These features make KINNTREX attractive for tackling a wide range of biomolecular questions. In addition, the versatility of KINNTREX can inspire more NN-based applications to time-resolved data from biological macromolecules obtained by other methods.},

  abstract = {Protein crystallography is the most widely used method for determining the molecular structure of proteins and obtaining structural information on protein–ligand complexes at the atomic level. As the structure determines the functions and properties of a protein, crystallography is of immense importance for nearly all research fields related to biochemistry. However, protein crystallography suffers from some major drawbacks, whereby the unpredictability of the crystallization process represents the main bottleneck. Crystallization is still more or less a ‘trial and error’ based procedure, and therefore, very time and resource consuming. Many strategies ~have been developed in the past decades to improve or enable the crystallization of proteins, whereby the use of so-called additives, which are mostly small molecules that make proteins more amenable to crystallization, is one of the most convenient and successful methods. Most of the commonly used additives are, however, restricted to particular crystallization conditions or groups of proteins. Therefore, a more universal additive addressing a wider range of proteins and being applicable to a broad spectrum of crystallization conditions would represent a significant advance in the field of protein crystallography. In recent years, polyoxometalates (POMs) emerged as a promising group of crystallization additives due to their unique structures and properties. In this regard, the tellurium-centered Anderson–Evans polyoxotungstate [TeW6O24]6- (TEW) showed its high potential as crystallization additive. In this lecture text, the development of POMs as tools in protein crystallography are discussed with a special focus on the so far most successful cluster TEW.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular X-ray crystallography is the predominant method used for protein structure determination; however, data collection is impeded by sample radiation damage. Global radiation damage manifests as a loss of diffraction intensity, whereas specific radiation damage causes structural changes at radiation sensitive features.  This thesis investigates the radiation sensitive, iron binding protein FutA from the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus MED4. FutA is thought to function primarily as a periplasmic ferric iron (Fe3+) binding protein but may facilitate a second function as an intracellular  ferrous iron (Fe2+) binding protein. Structure determination of FutA by X-ray  crystallographic methods is impeded by X-ray induced photoreduction of the ferric iron to  ferrous iron. Thus, radiation dose-limiting data collection techniques are required to  determine an accurate structure of the ferric state. Many radiation dose-limiting data collection techniques have strict sample requirements that  specify crystal size, number, and morphology. This thesis discusses the construction of a  crystallisation phase diagram for FutA to elucidate the relationship between crystallisation  components and the resulting crystal sample. The information provided by the phase  diagram allowed suitable FutA samples to be produced for radiation dose-limiting structure  determination. As a result, this thesis presents the first radiation-damage-free structure of  ferric bound FutA solved using serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). The sensitivity of FutA to X-ray induced photoreduction was utilised to investigate the  potential dual ferric and ferrous iron binding function of FutA. The structural response to  photoreduction was determined using dose-series produced by serial synchrotron  crystallography (SSX) and was corroborated by the capture of the ferrous state using lowdose, single-crystal X-ray diffraction with a home-source. The photoreduction of FutA was  characterised by a repositioning of Arg203 which is thought to stabilise the change in the  iron redox state. The ability of FutA to stabilise the change in the redox state from ferric to  ferrous iron may be indicative of an in vivo ferrous iron binding function. Many of the radiation-limiting data collection techniques used for FutA structure  determination required large amounts of protein material. As a result, these techniques are  unsuitable for proteins where the production of crystals is difficult. VMXm is a new  micro/nano-focus beamline at Diamond Light Source (UK) which aims to facilitate data  collection from crystals limited in size and number. At crystal sizes targeted by VMXm,  improvements in crystal lifetime are expected, because global radiation damage is reduced  due to the effect of photoelectron escape. In this thesis, the effect of photoelectron escape  on the lifetime of microcrystals (3 – 11 µm) was investigated, where crystal lifetime was  found to improve by a factor of 1.4 between a 3 µm and 10 µm crystal at 22.3 keV X-ray  energy. The measured gains in crystal lifetime presented here corroborate the predicted gains  in crystal lifetime by Cowan and Nave (2008)2, when residual liquid surrounding the crystal is  accounted for},

  abstract = {The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is a main contributor to global photosynthesis, whilst being limited by iron availability. Cyanobacterial genomes typically encode two different types of FutA iron binding proteins: periplasmic FutA2 ABC transporter subunits bind Fe(III), while cytosolic FutA1 binds Fe(II). Owing to their small size and their economized genome Prochlorococcus ecotypes typically possess a single futA gene. How the encoded FutA protein might bind different Fe oxidation states was previously unknown. Here we use structural biology techniques at room temperature to probe the dynamic behavior of FutA. Neutron diffraction confirmed four negatively charged tyrosinates, that together with a neutral water molecule coordinate iron in trigonal bipyramidal geometry.

Dose series using serial synchrotron crystallography and an XFEL X-ray pump-probe approach capture the transition between Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, revealing how Arg203 operates as a switch to accommodate the different iron oxidation states. This switching ability of the Prochlorococcus FutA protein may reflect ecological adaptation by genome streamlining and loss of specialized FutA proteins. Significance Statement Oceanic primary production by marine cyanobacteria is a main contributor to carbon and nitrogen fixation. Prochlorococcus is the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth, with an annual carbon fixation comparable to the net global primary production from agriculture. Its remarkable ecological success is based on the ability to thrive in low nutrient waters. To manage iron limitation, Prochlorococcus possesses the FutA protein for iron uptake and homeostasis. We reveal a molecular switch in the FutA protein that allows it to accommodate binding of iron in either the Fe(III) or Fe(II) state using structural biology techniques at room temperature and provide a plausible mechanism for iron binding promiscuity.},

It involves melting a cryo sample with a laser beam to allow dynamics of the embedded particles to occur. Once the laser beam is switched off, the sample revitrifies within just a few microseconds, trapping the particles in their transient configurations, which can subsequently be imaged to obtain a snap shot of the dynamics at this point in time. While we have previously performed such experiments with a modified transmission electron microscope, we here demonstrate a simpler implementation that uses an optical microscope. We believe that this will make our technique more easily accessible and hope that it will encourage other groups to apply microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM to study the fast dynamics of a variety of proteins.},

  abstract = {X-ray-radiation-induced alterations to protein structures are still a severe problem in macromolecular crystallography. One way to avoid the influence of radiation damage is to reduce the X-ray dose absorbed by the crystal during data collection. However, here it is demonstrated using the example of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) that even a low dose of less than 0.06 MGy may induce structural alterations in proteins. This dose is about 500 times smaller than the experimental dose limit which should ideally not be exceeded per data set (i.e. 30 MGy) and 20 times smaller than previously detected specific radiation damage at the bR active site. To date, it is the lowest dose at which radiation modification of a protein structure has been described. Complementary use was made of high-resolution X-ray crystallography and online microspectrophotometry to quantitatively study low-dose X-ray-induced changes. It is shown that structural changes of the protein correlate with the spectroscopically observed formation of the so-called bR orange species. Evidence is provided for structural modifications taking place at the protein active site that should be taken into account in crystallographic studies which aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of bR function.},

The chains of hydrogen bonds (CHBs) and low-barrier hydrogen bonds (LBHBs) were proposed to play essential roles in enzyme catalysis and proton transport. However, high-resolution structural data from CHBs and LBHBs is limited. The challenge is that their ‘visualization’ requires ultrahigh-resolution structures of the ground and functionally important intermediate states to identify proton translocation events and perform their structural assignment. Our true-atomic-resolution structures of the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, a model in studies of proton transport, show that CHBs and LBHBs not only serve as proton pathways, but also are indispensable for long-range communications, signaling and proton storage in proteins. The complete picture of CHBs and LBHBs discloses their multifunctional roles in providing protein functions and presents a consistent picture of proton transport and storage resolving long-standing debates and controversies.},

Creation of electrochemical potential at the membrane is a universal step in energy transformation in a cell. Published atomic crystallographic models of early intermediate states of bR show a significant difference between them, and conclusions about pumping mechanisms have been contradictory. Here, we present a quantitative high-resolution crystallographic study of conformational changes in bR induced by X-ray absorption. It is shown that X-ray doses that are usually accumulated during data collection for intermediate-state studies are sufficient to significantly alter the structure of the protein. X-ray-induced changes occur primarily in the active site of bR. Structural modeling showed that X-ray absorption triggers retinal isomerization accompanied by the disappearance of electron densities corresponding to the water molecule W402 bound to the Schiff base. It is demonstrated that these and other X-ray-induced changes may mimic functional conformational changes of bR leading to misinterpretation of the earlier obtained X-ray crystallographic structures of photointermediates.},

  abstract = {Salt bridges in proteins are bonds between oppositely charged residues that are sufficiently close to each other to experience electrostatic attraction. They contribute to protein structure and to the specificity of interaction of proteins with other biomolecules, but in doing so they need not necessarily increase a protein's free energy of unfolding. The net electrostatic free energy of a salt bridge can be partitioned into three components: charge–charge interactions, interactions of charges with permanent dipoles, and desolvation of charges. Energetically favorable Coulombic charge–charge interaction is opposed by often unfavorable desolvation of interacting charges. As a consequence, salt bridges may destabilize the structure of the folded protein. There are two ways to estimate the free energy contribution of salt bridges by experiment: the pKa approach and the mutation approach. In the pKa approach, the contribution of charges to the free energy of unfolding of a protein is obtained from the change of pKa of ionizable groups caused by altered electrostatic interactions upon folding of the protein. The pKa approach provides the relative free energy gained or lost when ionizable groups are being charged. In the mutation approach, the coupling free energy between interacting charges is obtained from a double mutant cycle. The coupling free energy is an indirect and approximate measure of the free energy of charge–charge interaction. Neither the pKa approach nor the mutation approach can provide the net free energy of a salt bridge. Currently, this is obtained only by computational methods which, however, are often prone to large uncertainties due to simplifying assumptions and insufficient structural information on which calculations are based. This state of affairs makes the precise thermodynamic quantification of salt bridge energies very difficult. This review is focused on concepts and on the assessment of experimental methods and does not cover the vast literature. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in synchrotron sources, beamline optics and detectors are driving a renaissance in room-temperature data collection. The underlying impetus is the recognition that conformational differences are observed in functionally important regions of structures determined using crystals kept at ambient as opposed to cryogenic temperature during data collection. In addition, room-temperature measurements enable time-resolved studies and eliminate the need to find suitable cryoprotectants. Since radiation damage limits the high-resolution data that can be obtained from a single crystal, especially at room temperature, data are typically collected in a serial fashion using a number of crystals to spread the total dose over the entire ensemble. Several approaches have been developed over the years to efficiently exchange crystals for room-temperature data collection. These include               in situ               collection in trays, chips and capillary mounts. Here, the use of a slowly flowing microscopic stream for crystal delivery is demonstrated, resulting in extremely high-throughput delivery of crystals into the X-ray beam. This free-stream technology, which was originally developed for serial femtosecond crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers, is here adapted to serial crystallography at synchrotrons. By embedding the crystals in a high-viscosity carrier stream, high-resolution room-temperature studies can be conducted at atmospheric pressure using the unattenuated X-ray beam, thus permitting the analysis of small or weakly scattering crystals. The high-viscosity extrusion injector is described, as is its use to collect high-resolution serial data from native and heavy-atom-derivatized lysozyme crystals at the Swiss Light Source using less than half a milligram of protein crystals. The room-temperature serial data allow               de novo               structure determination. The crystal size used in this proof-of-principle experiment was dictated by the available flux density. However, upcoming developments in beamline optics, detectors and synchrotron sources will enable the use of true microcrystals. This high-throughput, high-dose-rate methodology provides a new route to investigating the structure and dynamics of macromolecules at ambient temperature.},

Upon laser photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin Mb a non-equilibrium population of protein structures is generated that relaxes over a broad time range extending from picoseconds to milliseconds. This process is associated with migration of the ligand to cavities in the matrix and with a reduction in the geminate rebinding rate by several orders of magnitude. Here we report nanosecond time-resolved Laue diffraction data to 1.55-Å resolution on a Mb mutant, which depicts the sequence of structural events associated with this extended relaxation. Motions of the distal E-helix, including the mutated residue Gln-64(E7), and of the CD-turn are found to lag significantly (100-300 ns) behind local rearrangements around the heme such as heme tilting, iron motion out of the heme plane, and swinging of the mutated residue Tyr-29(B10), all of which occur promptly (≤3 ns). Over the same delayed time range, CO is observed to migrate from a cavity distal to the heme known to bind xenon (called Xe4) to another such cavity proximal to the heme (Xe1). We propose that the extended relaxation of the globin moiety reflects reequilibration among conformational substates known to play an essential role in controlling protein function.},

  abstract = {Work carried out over the last 30 years unveiled the role of structural dynamics in controlling protein function. Cavity networks modulate structural dynamics trajectories and are functionally relevant; in globins they have been assigned a role in ligand migration and docking. These findings raised renewed interest for time-resolved structural investigations of myoglobin (Mb), a simple heme protein displaying a photosensitive iron-ligand bond. Photodissociation of MbCO generates a nonequilibrium population of protein structures relaxing over a time range extending from picoseconds to milliseconds. This process triggers ligand migration to matrix cavities with clear-cut effects on the rate and yield of geminate rebinding. Here, we report subnanosecond time-resolved Laue diffraction data on the triple mutant YQR-Mb [Leu-29(B10)Tyr, His-64(E7)Gln, Thr-67(E10)Arg] that depict the sequence of structural events associated with heme and protein relaxation from 100 ps to 316 ns and above. The photodissociated ligand rapidly ({$<$}0.1 ns) populates the Xe-binding cavity distal to the heme. Moreover, the heme relaxation toward the deoxy configuration is heterogeneous, with a slower phase (≈ns) evident in these experiments. Damping of the heme response appears to result from a strain exerted by the E-helix via the CD-turn; Phe-43(CD1), in close contact with heme, opposes tilt until the strain is relieved. A comparison with crystallographic data on wild-type Mb and mutants Leu(29)Phe or Leu(29)Trp suggests that the internal structure controls the rate and amplitude of the relaxation events. A correlation between structural dynamics as unveiled by Laue crystallography and functional properties of Mb is presented.},

The integration program PrOW allows deconvolution of spatially overlapped spots which are usually rejected by standard packages. By using dynamically adjusted profile-fitting areas, a carefully built library of reference spots and interpolation of reference profiles, this program also provides a more accurate evaluation of weak spots. In addition, by using Wilson statistics, it allows rejection of non-redundant strong outliers such as zingers, which otherwise may badly corrupt the data. A weighting method for optimizing structure-factor amplitude differences, based on Bayesian statistics and originally applied to low signal-to-noise ratio time-resolved Laue data, is also shown to significantly improve other types of subtle amplitude differences, such as anomalous differences.},

Serial femtosecond crystallography has allowed high-resolution structures to be determined from micro-meter sized crystals, whereas single particle coherent X-ray imaging requires development to extend the resolution beyond a few tens of nanometers. Here we describe an intermediate approach: the XFEL imaging of biological assemblies with helical symmetry. We collected X-ray scattering images from samples of microtubules injected across an XFEL beam using a liquid microjet, sorted these images into class averages, merged these data into a diffraction pattern extending to 2\,nm resolution, and reconstructed these data into a projection image of the microtubule. Details such as the 4\,nm tubulin monomer became visible in this reconstruction. These results illustrate the potential of single-molecule X-ray imaging of biological assembles with helical symmetry at room temperature.},

This approach models each pixel of a diffraction pattern and improves data processing of integrated peak intensities by enabling the correction of partially recorded reflections.

Another light reaction, named photoactivation, reduces catalytically inactive FADH° to FADH- without implication of DNA.

  abstract = {Conformational change mediates the biological functions of macromolecules. Crystallographic measurements can map these changes with extraordinary sensitivity as a function of mutations, ligands and time. A popular method for detecting structural differences between crystallographic data sets is the isomorphous difference map. These maps combine the phases of a chosen reference state with the observed changes in structure factor amplitudes to yield a map of changes in electron density. Such maps are much more sensitive to conformational change than structure refinement is, and are unbiased in the sense that observed differences do not depend on refinement of the perturbed state. However, even modest changes in unit-cell properties can render isomorphous difference maps useless. This is unnecessary. Described here is a generalized procedure for calculating observed difference maps that retains the high sensitivity to conformational change and avoids structure refinement of the perturbed state. This procedure is implemented in an open-source Python package, MatchMaps, that can be run in any software environment supporting PHENIX [Liebschner et al. (2019). Acta Cryst. D75, 861–877] and CCP4 [Agirre et al. (2023). Acta Cryst. D79, 449–461]. Worked examples show that MatchMaps `rescues' observed difference electron-density maps for poorly isomorphous crystals, corrects artifacts in nominally isomorphous difference maps, and extends to detecting differences across copies within the asymmetric unit or across altogether different crystal forms.},

Starting with the CO complex, illumination leads to photolysis of the Fe–CO bond, and migration of the photolyzed carbon monoxide (CO\(\ast\)) to a niche in the protein 8.1 Å from the heme iron; this cavity corresponds to that hosting an atom of Xe when the crystal is equilibrated with xenon gas at 7 atmospheres [Tilton, R. F., Jr., Kuntz, I. D. \& Petsko, G. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 2849–2857]. The site occupied by CO\(\ast\) corresponds to that predicted by molecular dynamics simulations previously carried out to account for the NO geminate rebinding of Mb-YQR observed in laser photolysis experiments at room temperature. This secondary docking site differs from the primary docking site identified by previous crystallographic studies on the photolyzed intermediate of wild-type sperm whale Mb performed at cryogenic temperatures [Teng et al. (1994) Nat. Struct. Biol. 1, 701–705] and room temperature [Šrajer et al. (1996) Science 274, 1726–1729]. Our experiment shows that the pathway of a small molecule in its trajectory through a protein may be modified by site-directed mutagenesis, and that migration within the protein matrix to the active site involves a limited number of pre-existing cavities identified in the interior space of the protein.},

  abstract = {The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Near-atomic resolution crystallography supported by in crystallo Raman spectroscopy and QM/MM calculations showed unambiguously that the archetypical cofactor-free uricase catalyzes uric acid degradation via a C5(S)-(hydro)peroxide intermediate. Low X-ray doses break specifically the intermediate C5OO(H) bond at 100 K, thus releasing O2 in situ, which is trapped above the substrate radical. The dose-dependent rate of bond rupture followed by combined crystallographic and Raman analysis indicates that ionizing radiation kick-starts both peroxide decomposition and its regeneration. Peroxidation can be explained by a mechanism in which the substrate radical recombines with superoxide transiently produced in the active site.},

  abstract = {New antitubercular drugs are vital due to the spread of resistant strains. Carbethoxyhexyl imidazole (CHImi) inhibits cytochrome P450 CYP124, which is a steroid-metabolizing enzyme that is important for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages. The available crystal structure of the CYP124–CHImi complex reveals two glycerol molecules in the active site. A 1.15 Å resolution crystal structure of the glycerol-free CYP124–CHimi complex reported here shows multiple conformations of CHImi and the CYP124 active site which were previously restricted by glycerol. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations show coherence of the ligand and enzyme conformations. Spectrophotometric titration confirmed the influence of glycerol on CHImi binding: the affinity decreases more than tenfold in glycerol-containing buffer. In addition, it also showed that glycerol has a similar effect on other azole and triazole CYP124 ligands. Together, these data show that glycerol may compromise structural–functional studies and impede rational drug-design campaigns.},

  abstract = {A major barrier to defining the structural intermediates that arise during the reversible photointerconversion of phytochromes between their biologically inactive and active states has been the lack of crystals that faithfully undergo this transition within the crystal lattice. Here, we describe a crystalline form of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterases/adenylyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain from the cyanobacteriochrome PixJ in Thermosynechococcus elongatus assembled with phycocyanobilin that permits reversible photoconversion between the blue light-absorbing Pb and green light-absorbing Pg states, as well as thermal reversion of Pg back to Pb. The X-ray crystallographic structure of Pb matches previous models, including autocatalytic conversion of phycocyanobilin to phycoviolobilin upon binding and its tandem thioether linkage to the GAF domain. Cryocrystallography at 150 K, which compared diffraction data from a single crystal as Pb or after irradiation with blue light, detected photoconversion product(s) based on Fobs - Fobs difference maps that were consistent with rotation of the bonds connecting pyrrole rings C and D. Further spectroscopic analyses showed that phycoviolobilin is susceptible to X-ray radiation damage, especially as Pg, during single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, which could complicate fine mapping of the various intermediate states. Fortunately, we found that PixJ crystals are amenable to serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) analyses using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). As proof of principle, we solved by room temperature SFX the GAF domain structure of Pb to 1.55-Å resolution, which was strongly congruent with synchrotron-based models. Analysis of these crystals by SFX should now enable structural characterization of the early events that drive phytochrome photoconversion.},

  abstract = {The high intensity of third-generation X-ray sources, along with the development of cryo-cooling of protein crystals at temperatures around 100\>K, have made it possible to extend the diffraction limit of crystals and to reduce their size. However, even with cryo-cooled crystals, radiation damage becomes a limiting factor. So far, the radiation damage has manifested itself in the form of a loss of overall diffracted intensity and an increase in the temperature factor. The structure of a protein (myrosinase) after exposure to different doses of X-rays in the region of 20 × 1015 photons\>mm-2 has been studied. The changes in the structure owing to radiation damage were analysed using Fourier difference maps and occupancy refinement for the first time. Damage was obvious in the form of breakage of disulfide bonds, decarboxylation of aspartate and glutamate residues, a loss of hydroxyl groups from tyrosine and of the methylthio group of methionine. The susceptibility to radiation damage of individual groups of the same kind varies within the protein. The quality of the model resulting from structure determination might be compromised owing to the presence of radiolysis in the crystal after an excessive radiation dose. Radiation-induced structural changes may interfere with the interpretation of ligand-binding studies or MAD data. The experiments reported here suggest that there is an intrinsic limit to the amount of data which can be extracted from a sample of a given size.},

We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged refinement, where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation–libration–screw (TLS) model. Modeling of 20 protein datasets at 1.1–3.1 Å resolution reduced cross-validated Rfree values by 0.3–4.9\%, indicating that ensemble models fit the X-ray data better than single structures. The ensembles revealed that, while most proteins display a well-ordered core, some proteins exhibit a ‘molten core’ likely supporting functionally important dynamics in ligand binding, enzyme activity and protomer assembly. Order–disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues. Thus, ensemble refinement extracts dynamical details from the X-ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding of structure–dynamics–function relationships.},

In recent years, several approaches employing light-inducible systems have emerged to enable time-resolved experiments that reveal protein dynamics at high atomic and temporal resolutions. However, very few enzymes are light-dependent, whereas macromolecules requiring ligand diffusion into an active site are ubiquitous. In this work we present a drop-on-drop sample delivery system that enables the study of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in microcrystal slurries. The system delivers ligand solutions in bursts of multiple picoliter-sized drops on top of a larger crystal-containing drop inducing turbulent mixing and transports the mixture to the X-ray interaction region with temporal resolution. We demonstrate mixing using fluorescent dyes, numerical simulations and time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography, which show rapid ligand diffusion through microdroplets. The drop-on-drop method has the potential to be widely applicable to serial crystallography studies, particularly of enzyme reactions with small molecule substrates.},

  abstract = {Emphasis is placed in this review article on recent aspects of the photochemistry of cellular DNA in which both the UVB and UVA components of solar radiation are implicated individually or synergistically. Interestingly, further mechanistic insights into the UV-induced formation of DNA photoproducts were gained from the application of new accurate and sensitive chromatographic and enzymic assays aimed at measuring base damage. Thus, each of the twelve possible dimeric photoproducts that are produced at the four main bipyrimidine sites can now be singled out as dinucleoside monophosphates that are enzymatically released from UV-irradiated DNA. This was achieved using a recently developed high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay (HPLC–MS/MS) assay after DNA extraction and appropriate enzymic digestion. Interestingly, a similar photoproduct distribution pattern is observed in both isolated and cellular DNA upon exposure to low doses of either UVC or UVB radiation. This applies more specifically to the DNA of rodent and human cells, the cis-syn cyclobutadithymine being predominant over the two other main photolesions, namely thymine-cytosine pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone adduct and the related cyclobutyl dimer. UVA-irradiation was found to generate cyclobutane dimers at TT and to a lower extent at TC sites as a likely result of energy transfer mechanism involving still unknown photoexcited chromophore(s). Oxidative damage to DNA is also induced although less efficiently by UVA-mediated photosensitization processes that mostly involved 1O2 together with a smaller contribution of hydroxyl radical-mediated reactions through initially generated superoxide radicals.},

X-ray crystallography has been used to solve the structures of more than 100\,000 proteins; however, the vast majority represent long-lived states that do not capture the functional motions of these molecular machines. Reactions triggered by the addition of a ligand can be the most challenging to detect with crystallography because of the difficulty of synchronizing reactions to create detectable quantities of transient states. The development of X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) enables new approaches for solving protein structures following the rapid diffusion of ligands into micron sized protein crystals. Conformational changes occurring on millisecond timescales can be detected and time-resolved. Here, we describe a new XFEL injector which incorporates a microfluidic mixer to rapidly combine reactant and sample milliseconds before the sample reaches the X-ray beam. The mixing injector consists of bonded, concentric glass capillaries. The fabrication process, employing custom laser cut centering spacers and UV curable epoxy, ensures precise alignment of capillaries for repeatable, centered sample flow and dependable mixing. Crystal delivery capillaries are 50 or 75\,μm in diameter and can contain an integrated filter depending on the demands of the experiment. Reaction times can be varied from submillisecond to several hundred milliseconds. The injector features rapid and uniform mixing, low sample dilution, and high hit rates. It is fully compatible with existing SFX beamlines.},

The mechanisms of x-radiation damage in colored or redox proteins have often been investigated by combining X-ray crystallography with in crystallo ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Here, we used Raman microspectrophotometry to follow the onset of damage in crystalline lysozyme, notably that of disulfide bond breakage. The dose-dependent Raman spectra are consistent with a kinetic model for the rupture of disulfide bonds suggesting the rapid build up of an anionic radical intermediate. This intermediate may either revert back to the oxidized state or evolve toward protonated radical species or cleaved products. The data strongly suggest that back conversion of the anionic radical is significantly accelerated by X-rays, revealing an X-ray-induced “repair” mechanism. The possibility of X-ray-induced chemical repair is an important feature to take into account when assessing radiation damage in macromolecules.},

  abstract = {Phytochromes are red/far-red light photoreceptors in bacteria to plants, which elicit a variety of important physiological responses. They display a reversible photocycle between the resting Pr state and the light-activated Pfr state. Light signals are transduced as structural change through the entire protein to modulate its activity. It is unknown how the Pr-to-Pfr interconversion occurs, as the structure of intermediates remains notoriously elusive. Here, we present short-lived crystal structures of the photosensory core modules of the bacteriophytochrome from myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca captured by an X-ray free electron laser 5~ns and 33~ms after light illumination of the Pr state. We observe large structural displacements of the covalently bound bilin chromophore, which trigger a bifurcated signaling pathway that extends through the entire protein. The snapshots show with atomic precision how the signal progresses from the chromophore, explaining how plants, bacteria, and fungi sense red light.},

  abstract = {Low-pass spectral analysis (LPSA) is a recently developed dynamics retrieval algorithm showing excellent retrieval properties when applied to model data affected by extreme incompleteness and stochastic weighting. In this work, we apply LPSA to an experimental time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) dataset from the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and analyze its parametric sensitivity. While most dynamical modes are contaminated by nonphysical high-frequency features, we identify two dominant modes, which are little affected by spurious frequencies. The dynamics retrieved using these modes shows an isomerization signal compatible with previous findings. We employ synthetic data with increasing timing uncertainty, increasing incompleteness level, pixel-dependent incompleteness, and photon counting errors to investigate the root cause of the high-frequency contamination of our TR-SFX modes. By testing a range of methods, we show that timing errors comparable to the dynamical periods to be retrieved produce a smearing of dynamical features, hampering dynamics retrieval, but with no introduction of spurious components in the solution, when convergence criteria are met. Using model data, we are able to attribute the high-frequency contamination of low-order dynamical modes to the high levels of noise present in the data. Finally, we propose a method to handle missing observations that produces a substantial dynamics retrieval improvement from synthetic data with a significant static component. Reprocessing of the bR TR-SFX data using the improved method yields dynamical movies with strong isomerization signals compatible with previous findings.},

Here, the results obtained from the analysis of a thousand single-shot, room-temperature X-ray FEL diffraction images from two-dimensional crystals of a bacteriorhodopsin mutant are reported in detail. The high redundancy in the measurements boosts the intensity signal-to-noise ratio, so that the values of the diffracted intensities can be reliably determined down to the detector-edge resolution of 4 Å. The results show that two-dimensional serial crystallography at X-ray FELs is a suitable method to study membrane proteins to near-atomic length scales at ambient temperature. The method presented here can be extended to pump–probe studies of optically triggered structural changes on submillisecond timescales in two-dimensional crystals, which allow functionally relevant large-scale motions that may be quenched in three-dimensional crystals.},

Here, using femtosecond X-ray crystallography, we report the structural changes that take place while electrons transfer along a chain of four conserved tryptophans in the Drosophila melanogaster (6-4) photolyase. At femto- and picosecond delays, photoreduction of the flavin by the first tryptophan causes directed structural responses at a key asparagine, at a conserved salt bridge, and by rearrangements of nearby water molecules. We detect charge-induced structural changes close to the second tryptophan from 1 ps to 20 ps, identifying a nearby methionine as an active participant in the redox chain, and from 20 ps around the fourth tryptophan. The photolyase undergoes highly directed and carefully timed adaptations of its structure. This questions the validity of the linear solvent response approximation in Marcus theory and indicates that evolution has optimized fast protein fluctuations for optimal charge transfer.},

Photolyases/cryptochromes, which repair DNA and signal in all kingdoms of life, have a paradigm electron transfer cascade.

We report femtosecond X-ray crystallographic snapshots for the Drosophila melanogaster (6-4) photolyase, revealing protein structural changes while electron transfer occurs. At femto- and picosecond delays, photoreduction of the flavin by the first tryptophan causes directed structural responses at key residue asparagine 403, at a conserved salt bridge, and by rearrangements of nearby water molecules. Along the tryptophan cascade, we detect charge-induced protein structural changes close to the second tryptophan from 1 ps to 20 ps, thereby identifying methionine 408 as an active participant in the redox chain, and from 300 ps around the fourth tryptophan.

Here, we test the limits of its predictive power on fold-switching proteins, which assume two structures with regions of distinct secondary and/or tertiary structure. We find that (1) AF is a weak predictor of fold switching and (2) some of its successes result from memorization of training-set structures rather than learned protein energetics. Combining {$>$}280,000 models from several implementations of AF2 and AF3, a 35\% success rate was achieved for fold switchers likely in AF’s training sets. AF2’s confidence metrics selected against models consistent with experimentally determined fold-switching structures and failed to discriminate between low and high energy conformations. Further, AF captured only one out of seven experimentally confirmed fold switchers outside of its training sets despite extensive sampling of an additional \textasciitilde 280,000 models. Several observations indicate that AF2 has memorized structural information during training, and AF3 misassigns coevolutionary restraints. These limitations constrain the scope of successful predictions, highlighting the need for physically based methods that readily predict multiple protein conformations.},

The first structure identified in a protein family enables inference of the fold and of ancient relationships to other proteins; in the year ending 31 January 2005, about half of such structures were solved at a SG center rather than in a traditional laboratory. Furthermore, the cost of solving a structure at the most efficient SG center in the United States has dropped to one-quarter of the estimated cost of solving a structure by traditional methods. However, the efficiency of the top structural biology laboratories—even though they work on very challenging structures—is comparable to that of SG centers; moreover, traditional structural biology papers are cited significantly more often, suggesting greater current impact.},

One motivation for the development of such X-ray sources was the proposal to obtain structures of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and virus particles, without the need for crystallization, through diffraction measurements of single noncrystalline objects. Initial explorations of this idea and of outrunning radiation damage with femtosecond pulses led to the development of serial crystallography and the ability to obtain high-resolution structures of small crystals without the need for cryogenic cooling. This technique allows the understanding of conformational dynamics and enzymatics and the resolution of intermediate states in reactions over timescales of 100 fs to minutes. The promise of more photons per atom recorded in a diffraction pattern than electrons per atom contributing to an electron micrograph may enable diffraction measurements of single molecules, although challenges remain.},

  abstract = {Cryptochromes (CRYs) are composed of a core domain with structural similarity to photolyase and a distinguishing C-terminal extension. While plant and fly CRYs act as circadian photoreceptors, using the C terminus for light signaling, mammalian CRY1 and CRY2 are integral components of the circadian oscillator. However, the function of their C terminus remains to be resolved. Here, we show that the C-terminal extension of mCRY1 harbors a nuclear localization signal and a putative coiled-coil domain that drive nuclear localization via two independent mechanisms and shift the equilibrium of shuttling mammalian CRY1 (mCRY1)/mammalian PER2 (mPER2) complexes towards the nucleus. Importantly, deletion of the complete C terminus prevents mCRY1 from repressing CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcription, whereas a plant photolyase gains this key clock function upon fusion to the last 100 amino acids of the mCRY1 core and its C terminus. Thus, the acquirement of different (species-specific) C termini during evolution not only functionally separated cryptochromes from photolyase but also caused diversity within the cryptochrome family.},

  abstract = {The advent of the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) in the last decade created the discipline of serial crystallography but also the challenge of how crystal samples are delivered to X-ray. Early sample delivery methods demonstrated the proof-of-concept for serial crystallography and XFEL but were beset with challenges of high sample consumption, jet clogging and low data collection efficiency. The potential of XFEL and serial crystallography as the next frontier of structural solution by X-ray for small and weakly diffracting crystals and provision of ultra-fast time-resolved structural data spawned a huge amount of scientific interest and innovation. To utilize the full potential of XFEL and broaden its applicability to a larger variety of biological samples, researchers are challenged to develop better sample delivery methods. Thus, sample delivery is one of the key areas of research and development in the serial crystallography scientific community. Sample delivery currently falls into three main systems: jet-based methods, fixed-target chips, and drop-on-demand. Huge strides have since been made in reducing sample consumption and improving data collection efficiency, thus enabling the use of XFEL for many biological systems to provide high-resolution, radiation damage-free structural data as well as time-resolved dynamics studies. This review summarizes the current main strategies in sample delivery and their respective pros and cons, as well as some future direction.},

The holistic regulatory networks orchestrated by phytochromes, including conformational switching, subcellular localization, direct protein-protein interactions, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations, and translational and posttranslational controls to promote photomorphogenesis, are highly coordinated and regulated at multiple levels. During the past decade, advances using innovative approaches have substantially broadened our understanding of the sophisticated mechanisms underlying the phytochrome-mediated light signaling pathways. This review discusses and summarizes these discoveries of the role of the modular structure of phytochromes, phytochrome-interacting proteins, and their functions; the reciprocal modulation of both positive and negative regulators in phytochrome signaling; the regulatory roles of phytochromes in transcriptional activities, alternative splicing, and translational regulation; and the kinases and E3 ligases that modulate PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs to optimize photomorphogenesis.},

It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are~widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

  abstract = {A novel freeze-quench instrument with a characteristic «dead-time» of 137±18 μs is reported. The prototype has several key features that distinguish it from conventional freeze-quench devices and provide a significant improvement in time resolution: (a) high operating pressures (up to 400 bar) result in a sample flow with high linear rates (up to 200 m s-1); (b) tangential micro-mixer with an operating volume of ∼1 nl yields short mixing times (up to 20 μs); (c) fast transport between the mixer and the cryomedium results in short reaction times: the ageing solution exits the mixer as a free-flowing jet, and the chemical reaction occurs “in–flight” on the way to the cryomedium; (d) a small jet diameter (∼20 μm) and a high jet velocity (∼200 m s-1) provide high sample-cooling rates, resulting in a short cryofixation time (up to 30 μs). The dynamic range of the freeze-quench device is between 130 μs and 15 ms. The novel tangential micro-mixer efficiently mixes viscous aqueous solutions, showing more than 95\% mixing at η≤4 (equivalent to protein concentrations up to 250 mg ml-1), which makes it an excellent tool for the preparation of pre-steady state samples of concentrated protein solutions for spectroscopic structure analysis. The novel freeze-quench device is characterized using the reaction of binding of azide to metmyoglobin from horse heart. Reaction samples are analyzed using 77 K optical absorbance spectroscopy, and X–band EPR spectroscopy. A simple procedure of spectral analysis is reported that allows (a) to perform a quantitative analysis of the reaction kinetics and (b) to identify and characterize novel reaction intermediates. The reduction of dioxygen by the bo3-type quinol oxidase from Escherichia coli is assayed using the MHQ technique. In these pilot experiments, low-temperature optical absorbance measurements show the rapid oxidation of heme o3 in the first 137 μs of the reaction, accompanied by the formation of an oxo-ferryl species. X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that a short-living radical intermediate is formed during the oxidation of heme o3. The radical decays within ∼1 ms concomitant with the oxidation of heme b, and can be attributed to the PM reaction intermediate converting to the oxoferryl intermediate F. The general field of application of the freeze-quench methodology is discussed.},

It is composed of the N-terminal LOV (light–oxygen–voltage) domain, the C-terminal STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain, and a linker region connecting them. In this study, the photoreaction and kinetics of full-length YtvA and the intermolecular interaction with a downstream protein, RsbRA, were revealed by the transient grating method. Although N-YLOV-linker, which is composed of the LOV domain of YtvA with helices A′α and Jα, exhibits a diffusion change due to the rotational motion of the helices, the YtvA dimer does not show the diffusion change. This result suggests that the STAS domain inhibits the rotational movement of helices A′α and Jα. We found that the YtvA dimer formed a heterotetramer with the RsbRA dimer probably via the interaction between the STAS domains, and we showed the diffusion change upon blue light illumination with a time constant faster than 70 μs. This result suggests a conformational change of the STAS domains; i.e., the interface between the STAS domains of the proteins changes to enhance the friction with water by the rotation structural change of helices A′α and Jα of YtvA.},

  abstract = {Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are plant blue-light receptors that mediate phototropism, chloroplast movement, stomatal opening, rapid inhibition of growth of etiolated seedlings, and leaf expansion in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Their N-terminal region contains two light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains, which bind flavin mononucleotide and form a covalent adduct between a conserved cysteine and the flavin mononucleotide chromophore upon photoexcitation. The C-terminal region contains a serine/threonine kinase domain that catalyzes blue-light-activated autophosphorylation. Here, we have transformed the phot1 phot2 (phot1-5 phot2-1) double mutant with PHOT expression constructs driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. These constructs encode either wild-type phototropin or phototropin with one or both LOV-domain cysteines mutated to block their photochemistry. We selected multiple lines in each of the eight resulting categories of transformants for further physiological analyses. Specifically, we investigated whether LOV1 and LOV2 serve the same or different functions for phototropism and leaf expansion. Our results show that the LOV2 domain of phot1 plays a major role in phototropism and leaf expansion, as does the LOV2 domain of phot2. No complementation of phototropism or leaf expansion was observed for the LOV1 domain of phot1. However, phot2 LOV1 was unexpectedly found to complement phototropism to a considerable level. Similarly, transformants carrying a PHOT transgene with both LOV domains inactivated developed strong curvatures toward high fluence rate blue light. However, we found that the phot2-1 mutant is leaky and produces a small level of full-length phot2 protein. In vitro experiments indicate that cross phosphorylation can occur between functional phot2 and inactivated phot1 molecules. Such a mechanism may occur in vivo and therefore account for the functional activities observed in the PHOT transgenics with both lov domains inactivated. The implications of this mechanism with respect to phototropin function are discussed.},

  abstract = {The understanding of signal transduction mechanisms in photoreceptor proteins is essential for elucidating how living organisms respond to light as environmental stimuli. In this study, we investigated the ATP binding, photoactivation and signal transduction process in the photoactivatable adenylate cyclase from Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) upon blue light excitation. Structural models with ATP bound in the active site of native OaPAC at cryogenic as well as room temperature are presented. ATP is found in one conformation at cryogenic- and in two conformations at ambient-temperature, and is bound in an energetically unfavorable conformation for the conversion to cAMP. However, FTIR spectroscopic experiments confirm that this conformation is the native binding mode in dark state OaPAC and that transition to a productive conformation for ATP turnover only occurs after light activation.A combination of time-resolved crystallography experiments at synchrotron and X-ray Free Electron Lasers sheds light on the early events around the Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore in the light-sensitive BLUF domain of OaPAC. Early changes involve the highly conserved amino acids Tyr6, Gln48 and Met92. Crucially, the Gln48 side chain performs a180° rotation during activation, leading to the stabilization of the FAD chromophore. Cryo-trapping experimentsallowed us to investigate a late light-activated state of the reaction and revealed significant conformational changes in the BLUF domainaround the FAD chromophore.In particular, a Trpin/Metout transition upon illumination is observed for the first time in the BLUF domain and its role in signal transmissionvia α-helix 3 and 4 in the linker region between sensor and effector domain is discussed.},

  abstract = {The NPH1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a 120-kilodalton serine-threonine protein kinase hypothesized to function as a photoreceptor for phototropism. When expressed in insect cells, the NPH1 protein is phosphorylated in response to blue light irradiation. The biochemical and photochemical properties of the photosensitive protein reflect those of the native protein in microsomal membranes. Recombinant NPH1 noncovalently binds flavin mononucleotide, a likely chromophore for light-dependent autophosphorylation. The fluorescence excitation spectrum of the recombinant protein is similar to the action spectrum for phototropism, consistent with the conclusion that NPH1 is an autophosphorylating flavoprotein photoreceptor mediating phototropic responses in higher plants.},

  abstract = {Phototropins are blue-light receptors controlling a range of responses that serve to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. These include phototropism, light-induced stomatal opening, and chloroplast movements in response to changes in light intensity. Since the isolation of the Arabidopsis PHOT1 gene in 1997, phototropins have been identified in ferns and mosses where their physiological functions appear to be conserved. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, phot1 and phot2, that exhibit overlapping functions in addition to having unique physiological roles. Phototropins are light-activated serine/threonine protein kinases. Light sensing by the phototropins is mediated by a repeated motif at the N-terminal region of the protein known as the LOV domain. Photoexcitation of the LOV domain results in receptor autophosphorylation and an initiation of phototropin signaling. Here we summarize the photochemical and biochemical events underlying phototropin activation in addition to the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with photoreceptor signaling.},

Light sensing by the phototropins is mediated by a repeated motif at the N-terminal region of the protein known as the LOV domain. Bacterially expressed LOV domains bind flavin mononucleotide noncovalently and are photochemically active in solution. Irradiation of the LOV domain results in the formation of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct (LOV390) which thermally relaxes back to the ground state in the dark, effectively completing a photocycle that serves as a molecular switch to control receptor kinase activity. We have employed a random mutagenesis approach to identify further amino acid residues involved in LOV-domain photochemistry. Escherichia coli colonies expressing a mutagenized population of LOV2 derived from Avena sativa (oat) phot1 were screened for variants that showed altered photochemical reactivity in response to blue light excitation. One variant showed slower rates of LOV390 formation but exhibited adduct decay times 1 order of magnitude faster than wild type. A single Ile → Val substitution was responsible for the effects observed, which removes a single methyl group found in van der Waals contact with the cysteine sulfur involved in adduct formation. A kinetic acceleration trend was observed for adduct decay by decreasing the size of the isoleucine side chain. Our findings therefore indicate that the steric nature of this amino acid side chain contributes to stabilization of the C-S cysteinyl adduct.},

  abstract = {Fluorescent proteins derived from light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains offer advantages over green fluorescent protein (GFP) from their small size and efficacy under anaerobic conditions. The flavoprotein improved LOV (iLOV) was engineered from the blue light receptor phototropin as a reporter of viral infection. To inform the molecular basis for the improved, photoreversible, fluorescent properties of iLOV, we employed directed evolution and determined five LOV crystallographic structures. Comparative structural analyses between iLOV and its progenitors reveal mutation-induced constraints in the environment of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore; in iLOV, the methyl group of Thr-394 “crowds” the FMN isoalloxazine ring, Leu-470 triggers side chain “flipping” of Leu-472, and the terminal FMN phosphate shows increased anchoring. We further engineered iLOV variants that are readily detectable in bacterial and mammalian cells due to order-of-magnitude photostability increases. Structure determination of a resulting representative photostable iLOV (phiLOV) variant reveals additional constraints on the chromophore. Aromatic residues Tyr-401 and Phe-485 in phiLOV sandwich the FMN isoalloxazine ring from both sides, whereas Ser-390 anchors the side chain of FMN-interacting Gln-489 Our combined structural and mutational results reveal that constraining the FMN fluorophore yields improved photochemical properties for iLOV and its new photostable derivative. These findings provide a framework for structural fine-tuning of LOV scaffold proteins to maximize their potential as oxygen-independent fluorescent reporters.},

Rational design of improved fluorescent protein markers requires a better understanding of these environmental effects. We demonstrate here that solution NMR spectroscopy can detect subtle changes in the chemical structure, conformation, and dynamics of the photoactive chromophore moiety with atomic resolution, providing such mechanistic information. Studying rsFolder, a reversibly switchable green fluorescent protein, we have identified four distinct configurations of its p-HBI chromophore, corresponding to the cis and trans isomers, with each one either protonated (neutral) or deprotonated (anionic) at the benzylidene ring. The relative populations and interconversion kinetics of these chromophore species depend on sample pH and buffer composition that alter in a complex way the strength of H-bonds that contribute in stabilizing the chromophore within the protein scaffold. We show in particular the important role of histidine-149 in stabilizing the neutral trans chromophore at intermediate pH values, leading to ground-state cis–trans isomerization with a peculiar pH dependence. We discuss the potential implications of our findings on the pH dependence of the photoswitching contrast, a critical parameter in nanoscopy applications.},

To capture the reaction intermediates involved in the enzyme’s catalytic cycle, we conducted a time-resolved crystallography experiment. We found that photolyase traps the excited state of the active cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), in a highly bent geometry. This excited state performs electron transfer to damaged DNA, inducing repair. We show that the repair reaction, which involves the lysis of two covalent bonds, occurs through a single-bond intermediate. The transformation of the substrate into product crowds the active site and disrupts hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, resulting in stepwise product release, with the 3′ thymine ejected first, followed by the 5′ base.},

It is found exclusively in cyanobacteria, where it functions to control light-harvesting of the photosynthetic machinery. However, the photochemical reactions and structural dynamics of this unique photosensing process are not yet resolved. We present time-resolved crystal structures at second-to-minute delays under bright illumination, capturing the early photoproduct and structures of the subsequent reaction intermediates. The first stable photoproduct shows concerted isomerization of C9’-C8’ and C7’-C6’ single bonds in the bicycle-pedal (s-BP) manner and structural changes in the N-terminal domain with minute timescale kinetics. These are followed by a thermally-driven recovery of the s-BP isomer to the dark state carotenoid configuration. Structural changes propagate to the C-terminal domain, resulting, at later time, in the H-bond rupture of the carotenoid keto group with protein residues. Solution FTIR and UV/Vis spectroscopy support the single bond isomerization of the carotenoid in the s-BP manner and subsequent thermal structural reactions as the basis of OCP photoreception.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical properties of potential energy landscapes have been used to gain insight into thermodynamic and kinetic properties of protein ensembles. It also may be possible to use them to direct computational searches for thermodynamically stable macroscopic states, i.e., computational protein folding. To this end, we have developed a top-down search procedure in which conformation space is recursively dissected according to the intrinsic hierarchical structure of a landscape's effective-energy barriers. This procedure generates an inverted tree similar to the disconnectivity graphs generated by local minima-clustering methods, but it fundamentally differs in the manner in which the portion of the tree that is to be computationally explored is selected. A key ingredient is a branch-selection algorithm that takes advantage of statistically predictive properties of the landscape to guide searches down the tree branches that are most likely to lead to the physically relevant macroscopic states. Using the computational folding of a β-hairpin-forming peptide as an example, we show that such predictive properties indeed exist and can be used for structure prediction by free-energy global minimization.},

We present serial femtosecond X-ray crystallographic data of the chromophore-binding domains of a bacterial phytochrome at delay times of 1 ps and 10 ps after photoexcitation. The data reveal a twist of the D-ring, which leads to partial detachment of the chromophore from the protein. Unexpectedly, the conserved so-called pyrrole water is photodissociated from the chromophore, concomitant with movement of the A-ring and a key signaling aspartate. The changes are wired together by ultrafast backbone and water movements around the chromophore, channeling them into signal transduction towards the output domains. We suggest that the observed collective changes are important for the phytochrome photoresponse, explaining the earliest steps of how plants, fungi and bacteria sense red light.},

A successful monomerization attempt led to the development of the bright yellow-green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. The structures of lanYFP and mNeonGreen have been determined and compared in order to rationalize the directed evolution process leading from a bright, tetrameric to a still bright, monomeric fluorescent protein. An unusual discolouration of crystals of mNeonGreen was observed after X-ray data collection, which was investigated using a combination of X-ray crystallography and UV–visible absorption and Raman spectroscopies, revealing the effects of specific radiation damage in the chromophore cavity. It is shown that X-rays rapidly lead to the protonation of the phenolate O atom of the chromophore and to the loss of its planarity at the methylene bridge.},

An important goal in their understanding is the provision of detailed structural descriptions of the ultrafast photochemical events that they undergo, in particular of the excited states that connect chemistry to biological function. Here we report on the structures of two excited states in the reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We populated the states through femtosecond illumination of rsEGFP2 in its non-fluorescent off state and observed their build-up (within less than one picosecond) and decay (on the several picosecond timescale). Using an X-ray free-electron laser, we performed picosecond time-resolved crystallography and show that the hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone chromophore in one of the excited states assumes a near-canonical twisted configuration halfway between the trans and cis isomers. This is in line with excited-state quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our new understanding of the structure around the twisted chromophore enabled the design of a mutant that displays a twofold increase in its off-to-on photoswitching quantum yield.},

A downshift in both the C7═C8 and C1═O stretches upon photoexcitation reveals that the chromophore has shifted to an increasingly quinonic form in the excited state, indicating a charge shift from the phenolate moiety toward the C9═O carbonyl, which continues to increase for 170 fs. In addition, there is a downshift in the C9═O carbonyl out-of-plane vibration on an 800 fs time scale as PYP transitions from its excited state to I0, indicating that weakening of the hydrogen bond with Cys69 and out-of-plane rotation of the C9═O carbonyl are key steps leading to photoproduct formation. HOOP intensity increases on a 3 ps time scale during the formation of I0, signifying distortion about the C7═C8 bond. Once on the I0 surface, the C7═C8 and C1═O stretches blue shift, indicating recovery of charge to the phenolate, while persistent intensity in the HOOP and carbonyl out-of-plane modes reveal HCA to be a cissoid structure with significant distortion about the C7═C8 bond and of C9═O out of the molecular plane.},

Two flavin mononucleotide binding light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains are the sites for initial photochemistry in these blue light photoreceptors. We have determined the steady state, photoexcited crystal structure of a flavin-bound LOV domain. The structure reveals a unique photochemical switch in the flavin binding pocket in which the absorption of light drives the formation of a reversible covalent bond between a highly conserved Cys residue and the flavin cofactor. This provides a molecular picture of a cysteinyl-flavin covalent adduct, the presumed signaling species that leads to phototropin kinase activation and subsequent signal transduction. We identify closely related LOV domains in two eubacterial proteins that suggests the light-induced conformational change evident in this structure is an ancient biomolecular response to light, arising before the appearance of plants.},

  abstract = {Phototropin, a major blue-light receptor for phototropism in seed  plants, exhibits blue-light-dependent autophosphorylation and contains  two light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains and a serine/threonine  kinase domain. The LOV domains share homology with the PER-ARNT-SIM  (PAS) superfamily, a diverse group of sensor proteins. Each LOV domain  noncovalently binds a single FMN molecule and exhibits reversible  photochemistry in vitro when expressed separately or in  tandem. We have determined the crystal structure of the LOV2 domain  from the phototropin segment of the chimeric fern photoreceptor phy3 to  2.7-Å resolution. The structure constitutes an FMN-binding fold that  reveals how the flavin cofactor is embedded in the protein. The  single LOV2 cysteine residue is located 4.2 Å from flavin atom C(4a),  consistent with a model in which absorption of blue light induces  formation of a covalent cysteinyl-C(4a) adduct. Residues that interact  with FMN in the phototropin segment of the chimeric fern photoreceptor  (phy3) LOV2 are conserved in LOV domains from phototropin of other  plant species and from three proteins involved in the regulation of  circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis and  Neurospora. This conservation suggests that these  domains exhibit the same overall fold and share a common mechanism  for flavin binding and light-induced signaling.},

  abstract = {Learning the physiological role of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its interaction with aequorin could help understand how to create mutants that exhibit efficiency energy transfer and how to effectively control dimerization. The interaction of GFP with aequorin is readily reversible and is stabilized by high protein and salt concentrations—conditions likely to be encountered within the light-emitting organelles of Aequorea victoria. Both GFP and aequorin can dimerize under appropriate conditions, and it is the dimerized forms that are believed to interact. The molecular details of the interaction of aequorin with GFP are unknown, although it has been suggested that a C-terminal hydrophobic patch, deriving from amino acids 206,221, and 223, or a stretch of negative electrostatic potential could be plausible interaction domains. Although the significance of the heterogeneity of both GFP and aequorin has largely been ignored, it is possible that it favors the correct association of GFP with aequorin. At least one site of heterogeneity in the Aequorea-derived GFP nucleotide residues occurs at a position involved in GFP Dimerization. Isoform variation at this position was split between positively and negatively charged amino acids, which would favor the selective association of different isoforms.},

  abstract = {The biomineralization process is a mechanism inherent to all organisms of the Earth. Throughout the decades, diverse works have reported that the origin of life is tied to crystals, specifically to biominerals of silica that catalyzed RNA, and had some influence in the homochirality. Although the mechanism by which crystals surfaces (minerals) gave origin to life has not yet been proven, the truth is that, up to the present, biominerals are being synthetized by the organisms of different kingdoms in two basic ways: biologically induced and biologically controlled biomineralization. Paradoxically, this fact makes a fundamental difference between inorganic materials and those formed by living organisms, as the latter are associated with macromolecules that are bound to the mineral phase. Conserving growth and formation of these biogenic organic crystals inside cells is a fascinating subject that has been studied mainly in some of the kingdoms, like Monera (bacteria), Fungi (yeasts), and Animalia (Homo sapiens). Notwithstanding in the Plantae kingdom, the formation, conservation, and functions of crystals has not yet been completely elucidated and described, which is of particular relevance because life on Earth, as we know it, would not be possible without plants. The aim of the present work is to revise the different crystals of calcium oxalate synthetized inside the cells of plants, as well as to identify the mechanism of their formation and their possible functions in plants. The last part is related to the existence of certain proteins called phototropins, which not only work as the blue-light sensors, but they also play an important role on the accumulation of calcium in vacuoles. This new trend is shortly reviewed to explain the characteristics and their plausible role in the calcium uptake along with the biomineralization processes.},

  abstract = {Novel X-ray methods are transforming the study of the functional dynamics of biomolecules. Key to this revolution is detection of often subtle conformational changes from diffraction data. Diffraction data contain patterns of bright spots known as reflections. To compute the electron density of a molecule, the intensity of each reflection must be estimated, and redundant observations reduced to consensus intensities. Systematic effects, however, lead to the measurement of equivalent reflections on different scales, corrupting observation of changes in electron density. Here, we present a modern Bayesian solution to this problem, which uses deep learning and variational inference to simultaneously rescale and merge reflection observations. We successfully apply this method to monochromatic and polychromatic single-crystal diffraction data, as well as serial femtosecond crystallography data. We find that this approach is applicable to the analysis of many types of diffraction experiments, while accurately and sensitively detecting subtle dynamics and anomalous scattering.},

Sustained effort has resulted in an impressive arsenal of tools for determining the static structures. But under physiological conditions, macromolecules undergo continuous conformational changes, a subset of which are functionally important. Techniques for capturing the continuous conformational changes underlying function are essential for further progress. Here, we present chemically-detailed conformational movies of biological function, extracted data-analytically from experimental single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) snapshots of ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), a calcium-activated calcium channel engaged in the binding of ligands. The functional motions differ substantially from those inferred from static structures in the nature of conformationally active structural domains, the sequence and extent of conformational motions, and the way allosteric signals are transduced within and between domains. Our approach highlights the importance of combining experiment, advanced data analysis, and molecular simulations.},

Their catalytic performances, mechanisms, global folds, and active-site architectures are also highly diverse, suggesting that enzymes are shaped by an entire range of physiological demands and evolutionary constraints, as well as by chemical and physicochemical constraints. We have attempted to identify signatures of these shaping demands and constraints. To this end, we describe a bird’s-eye view of the enzyme space from two angles: evolution and chemistry. We examine various chemical reaction parameters that may have shaped the catalytic performances and active-site architectures of enzymes. We test and weigh these considerations against physiological and evolutionary factors. Although the catalytic properties of the “average” enzyme correlate with cellular metabolic demands and enzyme expression levels, at the level of individual enzymes, a multitude of physiological demands and constraints, combined with the coincidental nature of evolutionary processes, result in a complex picture. Indeed, neither reaction type (a chemical constraint) nor evolutionary origin alone can explain enzyme rates. Nevertheless, chemical constraints are apparent in the convergence of active-site architectures in independently evolved enzymes, although significant variations within an architecture are common.},

Like plant phytochromes, theD. radiodurans receptor covalently binds linear tetrapyrroles autocatalytically to generate a photochromic holoprotein. However, the attachment site is distinct, using a histidine to potentially form a Schiff base linkage.

One of the fastest occurring X-ray-induced processes involves redox modifications (reduction or oxidation) of redox-active cofactors in proteins. Here we analyze room-temperature data on the photoreduction of Mn ions in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II, one of the most radiation damage-sensitive proteins and a key constituent of natural photosynthesis in plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Time-resolved X-ray emission spectroscopy with wavelength-dispersive detection was used to collect data on the progression of X-ray-induced damage. A kinetic model was developed to fit experimental results, and the rate constant for the reduction of OEC MnIII and MnIV ions by solvated electrons was determined. From this model, the possible kinetics of X-ray-induced damage at a variety of experimental conditions, such as different rates of dose deposition as well as different excitation wavelengths, can be inferred. We observed a trend of increasing dosage threshold prior to the onset of X-ray-induced damage with increasing rates of dose deposition. This trend suggests that experimentation with higher rates of dose deposition is beneficial for measurements of biological samples sensitive to radiation damage, particularly at pink beam and X-ray free electron laser sources.},

By using the full energy range, a new option for structural studies of crystalline materials may become possible. The proof of concept of broad-bandpass diffraction presented here is based on Laue single-crystal microdiffraction and the experimental setup on BL12.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley. Diffraction patterns for 100 randomly oriented stationary crystallites of the MFI-type zeolite ZSM-5 were simulated assuming several bandwidths, and the statistical and structural results are discussed. With a 4\% energy bandwidth, the number of reflection intensities measured in a single shot is significantly higher than with monochromatic radiation. Furthermore, the problem of partial reflection measurement, which is inherent to the monochromatic mode with stationary crystals, can be overcome.},

  abstract = {Radiation damage limits the accuracy of macromolecular structures in X-ray crystallography. Cryogenic (cryo-) cooling reduces the global radiation damage rate and, therefore, became the method of choice over the past decades. The recent advent of serial crystallography, which spreads the absorbed energy over many crystals, thereby reducing damage, has rendered room temperature (RT) data collection more practical and also extendable to microcrystals, both enabling and requiring the study of specific and global radiation damage at RT. Here, we performed sequential serial raster-scanning crystallography using a microfocused synchrotron beam that allowed for the collection of two series of 40 and 90 full datasets at 2- and 1.9-Å resolution at a dose rate of 40.3 MGy/s on hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) crystals at RT and cryotemperature, respectively. The diffraction intensity halved its initial value at average doses (D1/2) of 0.57 and 15.3 MGy at RT and 100 K, respectively. Specific radiation damage at RT was observed at disulfide bonds but not at acidic residues, increasing and then apparently reversing, a peculiar behavior that can be modeled by accounting for differential diffraction intensity decay due to the nonuniform illumination by the X-ray beam. Specific damage to disulfide bonds is evident early on at RT and proceeds at a fivefold higher rate than global damage. The decay modeling suggests it is advisable not to exceed a dose of 0.38 MGy per dataset in static and time-resolved synchrotron crystallography experiments at RT. This rough yardstick might change for proteins other than HEWL and at resolutions other than 2 Å.},

Fe(II) reduction of the heme iron in aquomet-myoglobin, induced by x-rays at cryogenics temperatures, produces a thermally trapped nonequilibrium state in which a water molecule is still bound to the iron. Water dissociates at T [ 160 K, when the protein can relax toward its new equilibrium, deoxy form. Synchrotron radiation x-ray absorption spectroscopy provides information on both the redox state and the Fe-heme structure. Owing to the development of a novel method to analyze the low-energy region of x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we obtain structural pictures of this photoinducible, irreversible process, with 0.02–0.06-A˚ accuracy, on the protein in solution as well as in crystal. After photo-reduction, the iron-proximal histidine bond is shortened by 0.15 A˚ , a reinforcement that should destabilize the iron in-plane position favoring water dissociation. Moreover, we are able to get the distance of the water molecule even after dissociation from the iron, with a 0.16-A˚ statistical error.},

  abstract = {Using the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules to infer how they function is one of the most important fields of modern biology. The availability of atomic resolution structures provides a deep and unique understanding of protein function, and helps to unravel the inner workings of the living cell. To date, 86\% of the Protein Data Bank (rcsb-PDB) entries are macromolecular structures that were determined using X-ray crystallography., To obtain crystals suitable for crystallographic studies, the macromolecule (e.g. protein, nucleic acid, protein-protein complex or protein-nucleic acid complex) must be purified to homogeneity, or as close as possible to homogeneity. The homogeneity of the preparation is a key factor in obtaining crystals that diffract to high resolution (Bergfors, 1999; McPherson, 1999)., Crystallization requires bringing the macromolecule to supersaturation. The sample should therefore be concentrated to the highest possible concentration without causing aggregation or precipitation of the macromolecule (usually 2-50 mg/ mL). Introducing the sample to precipitating agent can promote the nucleation of protein crystals in the solution, which can result in large three-dimensional crystals growing from the solution. There are two main techniques to obtain crystals: vapor diffusion and batch crystallization. In vapor diffusion, a drop containing a mixture of precipitant and protein solutions is sealed in a chamber with pure precipitant. Water vapor then diffuses out of the drop until the osmolarity of the drop and the precipitant are equal (Figure 1A). The dehydration of the drop causes a slow concentration of both protein and precipitant until equilibrium is achieved, ideally in the crystal nucleation zone of the phase diagram. The batch method relies on bringing the protein directly into the nucleation zone by mixing protein with the appropriate amount of precipitant (Figure 1B). This method is usually performed under a paraffin/mineral oil mixture to prevent the diffusion of water out of the drop., Here we will demonstrate two kinds of experimental setup for vapor diffusion, hanging drop and sitting drop, in addition to batch crystallization under oil.},

  abstract = {For macromolecular structure determination at synchrotron sources, radiation damage remains a major limiting factor. Estimation of the absorbed dose (J kg-1) during data collection at these sources by programs such as RADDOSE-3D has allowed direct comparison of radiation damage between experiments carried out with different samples and beam parameters. This has enabled prediction of roughly when radiation damage will manifest so it can potentially be avoided. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), which produce intense X-ray pulses only a few femtoseconds in duration, can be used to generate diffraction patterns before most of the radiation damage processes have occurred and hence hypothetically they enable the determination of damage-free atomic resolution structures. In spite of this, several experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that structures from XFELs are not always free of radiation damage. There are currently no freely available programs designed to calculate the dose absorbed during XFEL data collection. This article presents an extension to RADDOSE-3D called RADDOSE-XFEL, which calculates the time-resolved dose during XFEL experiments. It is anticipated that RADDOSE-XFEL could be used to facilitate the study of radiation damage at XFELs and ultimately be used prior to data collection so that experimenters can plan their experiments to avoid radiation damage manifesting in their structures.},

  abstract = {In macromolecular X-ray crystallography, typical data sets have substantial multiplicity. This can be used to calculate the consistency of repeated measurements and thereby assess data quality. Recently, the properties of a correlation coefficient, CC1/2, that can be used for this purpose were characterized and it was shown that CC1/2 has superior properties compared with `merging' R values. A derived quantity, CC\(\ast\), links data and model quality. Using experimental data sets, the behaviour of CC1/2 and the more conventional indicators were compared in two situations of practical importance: merging data sets from different crystals and selectively rejecting weak observations or (merged) unique reflections from a data set. In these situations controlled `paired-refinement' tests show that even though discarding the weaker data leads to improvements in the merging R values, the refined models based on these data are of lower quality. These results show the folly of such data-filtering practices aimed at improving the merging R values. Interestingly, in all of these tests CC1/2 is the one data-quality indicator for which the behaviour accurately reflects which of the alternative data-handling strategies results in the best-quality refined model. Its properties in the presence of systematic error are documented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a promising fluorescent marker which is active in a diverse array of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. A key feature underlying the versatility of GFP is its capacity to undergo heterocyclic chromophore formation by cyclization of a tripeptide present in its primary sequence and thereby acquiring fluorescent activity in a variety of intracellular environments. In order to define further the primary structure requirements for chromophore formation and fluorescence in GFP, a series of N- and C-terminal GFP deletion variant expression vectors were created using the polymerase chain reaction. Scanning spectrofluorometric analyses of crude soluble protein extracts derived from eleven GFP expression constructs revealed that amino acid (aa) residues 2–232, of a total of 238 aa in the native protein, were required for the characteristic emission and absorption spectra of native GFP. Heterocyclic chromophore formation was assayed by comparing the absorption spectrum of GFP deletion variants over the 300–500-nm range to the absorption spectra of full-length GFP and GFP deletion variants missing the chromophore substrate domain from the primary sequence. GFP deletion variants lacking fluorescent activity showed no evidence of heterocyclic ring structure formation when the soluble extracts of their bacterial expression hosts were studied at pH 7.9. These observations suggest that the primary structure requirements for the fluorescent activity of GFP are relatively extensive and are compatible with the view that much of the primary structure serves an autocatalytic function.},

  abstract = {Phytochromes constitute a family of photosensory proteins that are utilized by various organisms to regulate several physiological processes. Phytochromes bind a bilin pigment that switches its isomeric state upon absorption of red or far-red photons, resulting in protein conformational changes that are sensed by the organism. Previously, the ultrafast dynamics in bacterial phytochrome was resolved to atomic resolution by time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray diffraction (TR-SFX), showing extensive changes in its molecular conformation at 1 picosecond delay time. However, the large excitation fluence of mJ/mm2 used in TR-SFX questions the validity of the observed dynamics. In this work, we present an excitation-dependent ultrafast transient absorption study to test the response of a related bacterial phytochrome to excitation fluence. We observe excitation power-dependent sub-picosecond dynamics, assigned to the population of high-lying excited state Sn through resonantly enhanced two-photon absorption, followed by rapid internal conversion to the low-lying S1 state. Inspection of the long-lived spectrum under high fluence shows that in addition to the primary intermediate Lumi-R, spectroscopic signatures of solvated electrons and ionized chromophore radicals are observed. Supported by numerical modelling, we propose that under excitation fluences of tens of μJ/mm2 and higher, bacterial phytochrome partly undergoes photoionization from the Sn state in competition with internal conversion to the S1 state in 300~fs. We suggest that the extensive structural changes of related, shorter bacterial phytochrome, lacking the PHY domain, resolved from TR-SFX may have been affected by the ionized species. We propose approaches to minimize the two-photon absorption process by tuning the excitation spectrum away from the S1 absorption or using phytochromes exhibiting minimized or shifted S1 absorption.},

  abstract = {The best way to learn protein X-ray diffraction is by practical work in the laboratory. However, it would be very unsatisfying to perform the experiments without understanding why they have to be done in such and such a way. Moreover, at several stages in the determination of protein structures it is necessary to decide what the next step should be. For instance, after growing suitable crystals and soaking these crystals in solutions of heavy atom reagents, applying the isomorphous replacement method, how do you obtain the positions of the heavy atoms in the unit cell and, if you do have them, how do you proceed? Questions such as these can be answered only if you have some knowledge of the theoretical background of protein X-ray crystallography. This is presented in this chapter. A slow path will be followed, and a student with a minimal background in mathematics, but the desire to understand protein X-ray crystallography should be able to work through the chapter. A working knowledge of differentiation and integration is required. If you further accept that an X-ray beam can be regarded as a wave that travels as a cosine function and if you know what a vector is, you have a good start. Derivations and explanations that are not absolutely necessary to follow the text are set off within rules; these can be skipped, if you want.},

  abstract = {The second osmotic virial coefficients of seven proteins—ovalbumin, ribonuclease A, bovine serum albumin, α-lactalbumin, myoglobin, cytochrome c, and catalase—were measured in salt solutions. Comparison of the interaction trends in terms of the dimensionless second virial coefficient b2 shows that, at low salt concentrations, protein–protein interactions can be either attractive or repulsive, possibly due to the anisotropy of the protein charge distribution. At high salt concentrations, the behavior depends on the salt: In sodium chloride, protein interactions generally show little salt dependence up to very high salt concentrations, whereas in ammonium sulfate, proteins show a sharp drop in b2 with increasing salt concentration beyond a particular threshold. The experimental phase behavior of the proteins corroborates these observations in that precipitation always follows the drop in b2. When the proteins crystallize, they do so at slightly lower salt concentrations than seen for precipitation. The b2 measurements were extended to other salts for ovalbumin and catalase. The trends follow the Hofmeister series, and the effect of the salt can be interpreted as a water-mediated effect between the protein and salt molecules. The b2 trends quantify protein–protein interactions and provide some understanding of the corresponding phase behavior. The results explain both why ammonium sulfate is among the best crystallization agents, as well as some of the difficulties that can be encountered in protein crystallization.},

  abstract = {Structure-based drug design is highly dependent on the availability of structures of the protein of interest in complex with lead compounds. Ideally, this information can be used to guide the chemical optimization of a compound into a pharmaceutical drug candidate. A limitation of the main structural method used today – conventional X-ray crystallography – is that it only provides structural information about the protein complex in its frozen state. Serial crystallography is a relatively new approach that offers the possibility to study protein structures at room temperature (RT). Here, we explore the use of serial crystallography to determine the structures of the pharmaceutical target, soluble epoxide hydrolase. We introduce a new method to screen for optimal microcrystallization conditions suitable for use in serial crystallography and present a number of RT ligand-bound structures of our target protein. From a comparison between the RT structural data and previously published cryo-temperature structures, we describe an example of a temperature-dependent difference in the ligand-binding mode and observe that flexible loops are better resolved at RT. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and potential future advances of serial crystallography for use within pharmaceutical drug discovery.},

Thus, acquiring atomic-level ensemble models that accurately represent conformational heterogeneity is vital to deepen our understanding of how proteins work. Modeling ensemble information from X-ray diffraction data has been challenging, as traditional cryo-crystallography restricts conformational variability while minimizing radiation damage. Recent advances have enabled the collection of high quality diffraction data at ambient temperatures, revealing innate conformational heterogeneity and temperature-driven changes. Here, we used diffraction datasets for Proteinase K collected at temperatures ranging from 313 to 363~K to provide a tutorial for the refinement of multiconformer ensemble models. Integrating automated sampling and refinement tools with manual adjustments, we obtained multiconformer models that describe alternative backbone and sidechain conformations, their relative occupancies, and interconnections between conformers. Our models revealed extensive and diverse conformational changes across temperature, including increased bound peptide ligand occupancies, different Ca2+ binding site configurations and altered rotameric distributions. These insights emphasize the value and need for multiconformer model refinement to extract ensemble information from diffraction data and to understand ensemble–function relationships.},

Polarized absorption and linear dichroism are techniques that are used to study the optical properties of oriented systems. Unlike solutions, where light polarized in any direction is absorbed equally because the molecules are randomly oriented, the absorption of plane-polarized light by oriented molecules is dependent on the polarization direction of the incident light beam. Anisotropic absorption occurs because molecules fixed in space exhibit maximum absorption when the electric vector of the light is parallel to well-defined directions in the molecule. A polarized absorption experiment in which the spectra are measured in each of three orthogonal directions on a sample of known molecular orientation—such as a crystal of known structure—yields both the complete spectrum and the molecular direction of the transition moment for each absorption band. If, on the other hand, the transition moment directions are already established, the polarized absorption experiment along three orthogonal axes yields the molecular orientation. In a linear dichroism experiment, the difference between the optical densities in two directions is measured directly.},

  abstract = {The polarized absorption spectra of ferrimyoglobin cyanide, ammonia, azide, fluoride, formate, and water (acid ferrimyoglobin) complexes in single crystals are described. Special emphasis is placed on the polarization‐ratio (PR) spectrum—the spectrum of the intensity ratio for light absorbed along and perpendicular to the crystal symmetry axis. It is shown that the PR spectrum magnifies spectral effects that are otherwise obscured by wide absorption bands, and it is shown to be a most useful parameter for studying the spectra of those systems that are intrinsically broad and whose spectra do not show any sharpening at low temperature. The results confirm many general features of porphyrin spectra such as the polarization of the B and Q states, the vibronic nature of the Qv state, and the intensity imbalance in the Q0 state. The substances studied span a variety of spectral types, from low‐spin, through mixed‐spin, to high‐spin iron complexes. The high‐spin spectra show, in addition to porphyrin bands, charge‐transfer bands that are associated with iron dxz and dyz orbitals. The spectra manifest the splitting of these iron dπ orbitals, and some reasons for this are discussed. The Soret (B) bands are also shown to be split. The PR spectrum of the low‐spin azide complex uncovered a new excited state, transitions to which were shown to be polarized out of plane. Possible mechanisms for this transition are discussed. The absolute intensity of myoglobin crystal absorption spectra are shown to be unchanged from the solution values, indicating that the heme environment is comparable in the two media. The heme orientation is shown to be identical, within the precision of the subtle variations of the PR spectrum, for all the derivatives studied, with the possible exception of the azide.},

Specifically, serial synchrotron structures of a heme peroxidase enzyme reveal that X-ray induced changes occur at far lower doses than those at which diffraction quality is compromised (the Garman limit), consistent with previous studies on the reduction of heme proteins by low X-ray doses. In these structures, a functionally relevant bond length is shown to vary rapidly as a function of absorbed dose, with all room-temperature synchrotron structures exhibiting linear deformation of the active site compared with the XFEL structure. It is demonstrated that extrapolation of dose-dependent synchrotron structures to zero dose can closely approximate the damage-free XFEL structure. This approach is widely applicable to any protein where the crystal structure is altered by the synchrotron X-ray beam and provides a solution to the urgent requirement to determine intact structures of such proteins in a high-throughput and accessible manner.},

  abstract = {The role of surface wetting properties and their impact on the performance of 3D printed microfluidic droplet generation devices for serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) are reported. SFX is a novel crystallography method enabling structure determination of proteins at room temperature with atomic resolution using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). In SFX, protein crystals in their mother liquor are delivered and intersected with a pulsed X-ray beam using a liquid jet injector. Owing to the pulsed nature of the X-ray beam, liquid jets tend to waste the vast majority of injected crystals, which this work aims to overcome with the delivery of aqueous protein crystal suspension droplets segmented by an oil phase. For this purpose, 3D printed droplet generators that can be easily customized for a variety of XFEL measurements have been developed. The surface properties, in particular the wetting properties of the resist materials compatible with the employed two-photon printing technology, have so far not been characterized extensively, but are crucial for stable droplet generation. This work investigates experimentally the effectiveness and the long-term stability of three different surface treatments on photoresist films and glass as models for our 3D printed droplet generator and the fused silica capillaries employed in the other fluidic components of an SFX experiment. Finally, the droplet generation performance of an assembly consisting of the 3D printed device and fused silica capillaries is examined. Stable and reproducible droplet generation was achieved with a fluorinated surface coating which also allowed for robust downstream droplet delivery. Experimental XFEL diffraction data of crystals formed from the large membrane protein complex photosystem I demonstrate the full compatibility of the new injection method with very fragile membrane protein crystals and show that successful droplet generation of crystal-laden aqueous droplets intersected by an oil phase correlates with increased crystal hit rates.},

A sequence of structural changes, which is not yet fully understood, leads to activation of an output domain.

Here we report the room temperature crystal structure of the chromophore-binding domains of the Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome at 2.1\,Å resolution. The structure was obtained by serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography from microcrystals at an X-ray free electron laser. We find overall good agreement compared to a crystal structure at 1.35\,Å resolution derived from conventional crystallography at cryogenic temperatures, which we also report here. The thioether linkage between chromophore and protein is subject to positional ambiguity at the synchrotron, but is fully resolved with SFX. The study paves the way for time-resolved structural investigations of the phytochrome photocycle with time-resolved SFX.},

  abstract = {X-ray and electron diffraction studies of specific reaction intermediates, or reaction intermediate analogues, have produced a consistent picture of the structural mechanism of light-driven proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin. Of central importance within this picture is the structure of the L-intermediate, which follows the retinal all-trans to 13-cis photoisomerization step of the K-intermediate and sets the stage for the primary proton transfer event from the positively charged Schiff base to the negatively charged Asp-85. Here we report the structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin following red light illumination at 150 K. Single crystal microspectrophotometry showed that only the L-intermediate is populated in three-dimensional crystals under these conditions. The experimental difference Fourier electron density map and refined crystallographic structure were consistent with those previously presented (Royant, A., Edman, K., Ursby, T., Pebay-Peyroula, E., Landau, E. M., and Neutze, R. (2000) Nature 406, 645-648; Royant, A., Edman, K., Ursby, T., Pebay-Peyroula, E., Landau, E. M., and Neutze, R. (2001) Photochem. Photobiol. 74, 794-804). Based on the refined crystallographic structures, molecular dynamic simulations were used to examine the influence of the conformational change of the protein that is associated with the K-to-L transition on retinal dynamics. Implications regarding the structural mechanism for proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin are discussed.},

  abstract = {Bacteriorhodopsin is the simplest known photon-driven proton pump1 and as such provides a model for the study of a basic function in bioenergetics. Its seven transmembrane helices2 encompass a proton translocation pathway containing the chromophore, a retinal molecule covalently bound to lysine 216 through a protonated Schiff base, and a series of proton donors and acceptors. Photoisomerization of the all-trans retinal to the 13-cis configuration initiates the vectorial translocation of a proton from the Schiff base, the primary proton donor, to the extracellular side, followed by reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasm. Here we describe the high-resolution X-ray structure of an early intermediate in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin, which is formed directly after photoexcitation. A key water molecule is dislocated, allowing the primary proton acceptor, Asp\,85, to move. Movement of the main-chain Lys\,216 locally disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network of helix G, facilitating structural changes later in the photocycle.},

However, the crystallographic structures of the intermediate states are only relevant if the working cycle is not impaired by the crystal lattice. Therefore, we applied visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) microspectroscopy with microsecond time resolution to compare the photoreaction of a single bacteriorhodopsin crystal to that of bacteriorhodopsin residing in the native purple membrane. The analysis of the FTIR difference spectra of the resolved intermediate states reveals great similarity in structural changes taking place in the crystal and in PM. However, the kinetics of the photocycle are significantly altered in the threedimensional crystal as compared to PM. Strikingly, the L state decay is accelerated in the crystal, whereas the M decay is delayed. The physical origin of this deviation and the implications for trapping of intermediate states are discussed. As a methodological advance, time-resolved step-scan FTIR spectroscopy on a single protein crystal is demonstrated for the first time which may be used in the future to gauge the functionality of other crystallized proteins with the molecular resolution of vibrational spectroscopy.},

The TG signal of LOV2 without the linker part to the kinase domain exhibits the thermal grating signal due to the heat releasing from the excited state and a weak population grating by the adduct formation. The diffusion coefficients of the adduct product after forming the chemical bond between the chromophore and Cys residue are found to be slightly smaller than that of the reactant, which implies that the core shrinks slightly on the adduct formation. After that change, no significant conformational change was observed. On the other hand, the signal of LOV2 with the linker part to the kinase domain clearly shows very different diffusion coefficients between the original and the adduct species. The large difference indicates significant global conformational change of the protein moiety upon the adduct formation. More interestingly, the diffusion coefficient is found to be time-dependent in the observation time range. The dynamics representing the global conformational change is a clear indication of a spectral silent intermediate between the excited triplet state and the signaling product. From the temporal profile analysis of the signal, the rate of the conformational change is determined to be 2 ms.},

Although the absorption spectra did not change after the formation of the adduct species, a small volume expansion process with a time constant of 9~ms was observed for LOV2. For the LOV2-linker, at 293 K, a volume contraction process with a time constant of 140~μs was observed in addition to a volume expansion process with 9~ms and the diffusion coefficient change with 2~ms. The reaction intermediate species were characterized on the basis of their thermodynamic properties, such as changes in enthalpy, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. For the first intermediate (S390), the values of these properties were similar to those of the ground state for both LOV2 and LOV2-linker. A relatively large thermal expansion volume (0.09~cm3mol-1K-1) and a positive heat capacity change (4.7~kJ mol-1K-1) were detected for the intermediates of LOV2-linker. These characteristic features were interpreted in terms of structural fluctuation and exposure of hydrophobic residues in the linker domain, respectively. The enthalpy change of S390 of the LOV1 domain was significantly greater than changes for the LOV2 or LOV2-linker samples. Data from this study support a major conformational change of the linker region in the photochemical reaction of phototropin.},

  abstract = {The idea of using ultrashort X-ray pulses to obtain images of single proteins frozen in time has fascinated and inspired many. It was one of the arguments for building X-ray free-electron lasers. According to theory, the extremely intense pulses provide sufficient signal to dispense with using crystals as an amplifier, and the ultrashort pulse duration permits capturing the diffraction data before the sample inevitably explodes. This was first demonstrated on biological samples a decade ago on the giant mimivirus. Since then, a large collaboration has been pushing the limit of the smallest sample that can be imaged. The ability to capture snapshots on the timescale of atomic vibrations, while keeping the sample at room temperature, may allow probing the entire conformational phase space of macromolecules. Here we show the first observation of an X-ray diffraction pattern from a single protein, that of Escherichia coli GroEL which at 14\,nm in diameter is the smallest biological sample ever imaged by X-rays, and demonstrate that the concept of diffraction before destruction extends to single proteins. From the pattern, it is possible to determine the approximate orientation of the protein. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of ultrafast imaging of single proteins, opening the way to single-molecule time-resolved studies on the femtosecond timescale.},

  abstract = {Light is a major environmental signal for circadian rhythms. We have identified and analyzed cry, a novel Drosophila cryptochrome gene. All characterized family members are directly photosensitive and include plant blue light photoreceptors. We show that cry transcription is under circadian regulation, influenced by the Drosophila clock genes period, timeless, Clock, and cycle. We also show that cry protein levels are dramatically affected by light exposure. Importantly, circadian photosensitivity is increased in a cry-overexpressing strain. These physiological and genetic data therefore link a specific photoreceptor molecule to circadian rhythmicity. Taken together with the data in the accompanying paper, we propose that CRY is a major Drosophila photoreceptor dedicated to the resetting of circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {Light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domains are widely distributed in plants, algae, fungi, bacteria, and represent the photo-responsive domains of various blue-light photoreceptor proteins. Their photocycle involves the blue-light triggered adduct formation between the C(4a) atom of a non-covalently bound flavin chromophore and the sulfur atom of a conserved cysteine in the LOV sensor domain. LOV proteins show considerable variation in the structure of N- and C-terminal elements which flank the LOV core domain, as well as in the lifetime of the adduct state. Here, we report the photochemical, structural and functional characterization of DsLOV, a LOV protein from the photoheterotrophic marine α-proteobacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae which exhibits an average adduct state lifetime of 9.6 s at 20°C, and thus represents the fastest reverting bacterial LOV protein reported so far. Mutational analysis in D. shibae revealed a unique role of DsLOV in controlling the induction of photopigment synthesis in the absence of blue-light. The dark state crystal structure of DsLOV determined at 1.5 Å resolution reveals a conserved core domain with an extended N-terminal cap. The dimer interface in the crystal structure forms a unique network of hydrogen bonds involving residues of the N-terminus and the β-scaffold of the core domain. The structure of photoexcited DsLOV suggests increased flexibility in the N-cap region and a significant shift in the Cα backbone of β strands in the N- and C-terminal ends of the LOV core domain. The results presented here cover the characterization of the unusual short LOV protein DsLOV from Dinoroseobacter shibae including its regulatory function, extremely fast dark recovery and an N-terminus mediated dimer interface. Due to its unique photophysical, structural and regulatory properties, DsLOV might thus serve as an alternative model system for studying light perception by LOV proteins and physiological responses in bacteria.},

Using pump–probe schemes, this should make the mechanistic study of photoactive proteins and other suitable systems possible with time resolutions down to microseconds. In order to identify relevant time delays, time-resolved spectroscopic experiments directly performed on protein crystals are often desirable. To this end, an instrument has been built at the icOS Lab (in crystallo Optical Spectroscopy Laboratory) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility using reflective focusing objectives with a tuneable nanosecond laser as a pump and a microsecond xenon flash lamp as a probe, called the TR-icOS (time-resolved icOS) setup. Using this instrument, pump–probe spectra can rapidly be recorded from single crystals with time delays ranging from a few microseconds to seconds and beyond. This can be repeated at various laser pulse energies to track the potential presence of artefacts arising from two-photon absorption, which amounts to a power titration of a photoreaction. This approach has been applied to monitor the rise and decay of the M state in the photocycle of crystallized bacteriorhodopsin and showed that the photocycle is increasingly altered with laser pulses of peak fluence greater than 100 mJ cm-2, providing experimental laser and delay parameters for a successful TR-MX experiment.},

This paper describes how a highly porous crystalline framework of a cationic redox protein and an anionic macrocycle can be modulated by a small cationic effector. Ternary composites of protein (∼13 kDa), calix[8]arene (∼1.5 kDa), and effector (∼0.2 kDa) formed distinct crystalline architectures, dependent on the effector concentration and the crystallization technique. A combination of X-ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations was used to decipher the framework variations, which appear to be dependent on a calixarene conformation change mediated by the effector. This “switch” calixarene was observed in three states, each of which is associated with a different interaction network. Two structures obtained by co-crystallization with the effector contained an additional protein “pillar”, resulting in framework duplication and decreased porosity. These results suggest how protein assembly can be engineered by supramolecular host–guest interactions.},

Their catalytic mechanism employs the light-driven injection of an electron onto the DNA lesion to trigger the cleavage of cyclobutane- pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts inside duplex DNA. Spectroscopic and structural analysis has recently yielded a concise view of how photolyases recognize these DNA lesions involving two neighboring bases, catalyze the repair reaction within a nanosecond and still achieve quantum efficiencies of close to one. Apart from these mechanistic aspects, the potential of DNA photolyases for the generation of highly UV-resistant organisms, or for skin cancer prevention by ectopical application is increasingly recognized.},

This can be performed with the program POINTLESS. The scaling program then puts all the measurements on a common scale, averages measurements of symmetry-related reflections (using the symmetry determined previously) and produces many statistics that provide the first important measures of data quality. A new scaling program, AIMLESS, implements scaling models similar to those in SCALA but adds some additional analyses. From the analyses, a number of decisions can be made about the quality of the data and whether some measurements should be discarded. The effective `resolution' of a data set is a difficult and possibly contentious question (particularly with referees of papers) and this is discussed in the light of tests comparing the data-processing statistics with trials of refinement against observed and simulated data, and automated model-building and comparison of maps calculated with different resolution limits. These trials show that adding weak high-resolution data beyond the commonly used limits may make some improvement and does no harm.},

A major task is understanding the effect of the protein environment on the efficiency and direction of this reaction compared to what is observed in the gas and solution phases. In this study, we set out to visualize the hula twist (HT) mechanism in a fluorescent protein, which is hypothesized to be the preferred mechanism in a spatially constrained binding pocket. We use a chlorine substituent to break the twofold symmetry of the embedded phenolic group of the chromophore and unambiguously identify the HT primary photoproduct. Through serial femtosecond crystallography, we then track the photoreaction from femtoseconds to the microsecond regime. We observe signals for the photoisomerization of the chromophore as early as 300 fs, obtaining the first experimental structural evidence of the HT mechanism in a protein on its femtosecond-to-picosecond timescale. We are then able to follow how chromophore isomerization and twisting lead to secondary structure rearrangements of the protein β-barrel across the time window of our measurements.},

  abstract = {Interrogating fragment libraries by X-ray crystallography is a powerful strategy for discovering allosteric ligands for protein targets. Cryocooling of crystals should theoretically increase the fraction of occupied binding sites and decrease radiation damage. However, it might also perturb protein conformations that can be accessed at room temperature. Using data from crystals measured consecutively at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature, we found that transient binding sites could be abolished at the cryogenic temperatures employed by standard approaches. Changing the temperature at which the crystallographic data was collected could provide a deliberate perturbation to the equilibrium of protein conformations and help to visualize hidden sites with great potential to allosterically modulate protein function.},

Several methods are compared for estimation of the volume fractions of the two members of the twin so that measured data can be corrected for this twinning. The effect of these corrections on the final electron-density map is analyzed. Results show that when the volume fraction of the smaller crystal in a twinned specimen used for structure determination by multiple isomorphous replacement is 0-0.1, correction of diffraction data for twinning results in a small but significant improvement in the accuracy of the electron- density map.},

Beamline ID23-2 makes use of well characterized optical elements: a single-bounce silicon (111) monochromator and two mirrors in Kirkpatrick–Baez geometry to focus the X-ray beam. A major design goal of the ID23-2 beamline is to provide a reliable, easy-to-use and routine microfocus beam. ID23-2 started operation in November 2005, as the first beamline dedicated to microfocus macromolecular crystallography. The beamline has taken the standard automated ESRF macromolecular crystallography environment (both hardware and software), allowing users of ID23-2 to be rapidly familiar with the microfocus environment. This paper describes the beamline design, the special considerations taken into account given the microfocus beam, and summarizes the results of the first years of the beamline operation.},

Transport by aaLeuT is Cl- independent, whereas many neurotransmitter:sodium symporters from higher organisms depend on Cl- ions. However, the only Cl- ion identified in the aaLeuT structure interacts with nonconserved residues in extracellular loops, and thus the relevance of this binding site is unclear. Here, we use calculations of pKAs and homology modeling to predict the location of a functionally important Cl- binding site in serotonin transporter and other Cl--dependent transporters. We validate our model through the site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to coordinate the Cl- ion and through the observation of sequence conservation patterns in other Cl--dependent transporters. The proposed site is located midway across the membrane and is formed by residues from transmembrane helices 2, 6, and 7. It is close to the Na1 sodium binding site, thus providing an explanation for the coupling of Cl- and Na+ ions during transport. Other implications of the model are also discussed.},

They excel at X-ray diffraction applications in the energy range from 2 to 100 keV. The main reasons for their superiority are the direct detection of individual photons and the accurate determination of scattering and diffraction intensities over an extremely high dynamic range. The detectors were first adopted in macromolecular crystallography where they revolutionized data collection. They were soon also used for small-angle scattering, coherent scattering, powder X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy and increasingly high-energy applications. Here, we will briefly survey the history of HPC detectors, explain their technology and then show in detail how improved detection has transformed a wide range of experimental techniques. We will end with an outlook to the future, which will probably see HPC technology find even broader use, for example, in electron microscopy and medical applications.

Due to their protein architecture and common FAD chromophore, they belong to the same superfamily as photolyases (PHLs), an enzyme class that repairs UV-induced DNA lesions upon blue light absorption. Apart from their different functions the only prominent structural difference between CRY and PHL is the highly variable C-terminal extension (CTE) of the former. The nature of the CTE is still unclear and highly speculated. In this study, we show by hydrogen/deuterium exchange and subsequent mass-spectrometric analysis that the CTE of the animal-like cryptochrome from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CraCRY) binds to the surface of the photolyase homology region, which flanks the DNA binding site. We also compared the fully oxidized and fully reduced states of the flavoprotein and designed a tool, so called light chamber, for automated HDX-MS measurements of photoreceptors in defined photostates. We could observe some striking differences between the two photostates and propose a model for light-dependent switching of this bifunctional cryptochrome.},

Its 1.6 Å crystal structure shows besides the FAD chromophore an aromatic tetrad that is indispensable in animal-like type I cryptochromes for light-driven change of their signaling-active redox state and formation of a stable radical pair. Given CraCRY’s catalytic activity as (6-4) photolyase in vivo and in vitro, we present the first co-crystal structure of a cryptochrome with duplex DNA comprising a (6-4) pyrimidine–pyrimidone lesion. This 2.9 Å structure reveals a distinct conformation for the catalytic histidine His1, H357, that challenges previous models of a single-photon driven (6-4) photolyase mechanism.},

  abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100 K). The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast, here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30 different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions of more than 35\% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic, electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique models. Monitoring room-temperature conformational ensembles by X-ray crystallography can reveal motions crucial for catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric regulation.},

X-ray crystallography can provide snapshots of conformational substates sampled during enzymatic reactions, while NMR relaxation methods reveal the rates of interconversion between substates and the corresponding relative populations,. However, these current methods cannot simultaneously reveal the detailed atomic structures of the rare states and rationalize the finding that intrinsic motions in the free enzyme occur on a time scale similar to the catalytic turnover rate. Here we introduce dual strategies of ambient-temperature X-ray crystallographic data collection and automated electron-density sampling to structurally unravel interconverting substates of the human proline isomerase, cyclophilin A (CypA). A conservative mutation outside the active site was designed to stabilize features of the previously hidden minor conformation. This mutation not only inverts the equilibrium between the substates, but also causes large, parallel reductions in the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. These studies introduce crystallographic approaches to define functional minor protein conformations and, in combination with NMR analysis of the enzyme dynamics in solution, show how collective motions directly contribute to the catalytic power of an enzyme.},

These proteins contain flavin-binding LOV (Light-Oxygen-Voltage) domains that form covalent cysteine-flavin adducts upon exposure to blue light, leading to the enhancement of phototropin kinase activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that adduct formation in the phototropin LOV2 domains leads to the dissociation of an alpha helix (Jα) from these domains as part of the light-induced activation process. However, crystal structures of LOV domains both in the presence and absence of the Jα helix show very few differences between dark and illuminated states, and thus the precise mechanism through which adduct formation triggers helical dissociation remains poorly understood. Using Avena sativa phototropin 1 LOV2 as a model system, we have studied the interactions of the LOV domain core with the Jα helix through a series of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Here we show that conformational transitions of a conserved glutamine residue in the flavin binding pocket are coupled to altered dynamics of the Jα helix both through a shift in dynamics of the main β-sheet of the LOV domain core and through a secondary pathway involving the N-terminal A′α helix.},

  abstract = {Cyan fluorescent proteins (CFP) derived from Aequorea victoria GFP, carrying a tryptophan-based chromophore, are widely used as FRET donors in live cell fluorescence imaging experiments. Recently, several CFP variants with near-ultimate photophysical performances were obtained through a mix of site-directed and large scale random mutagenesis. To understand the structural bases of these improvements, we have studied more specifically the consequences of the single-site T65S mutation. We find that all CFP variants carrying the T65S mutation not only display an increased fluorescence quantum yield and a simpler fluorescence emission decay, but also show an improved pH stability and strongly reduced reversible photoswitching reactions. Most prominently, the Cerulean-T65S variant reaches performances nearly equivalent to those of mTurquoise, with QY = 0.84, an almost pure single exponential fluorescence decay and an outstanding stability in the acid pH range (pK1/2 = 3.6). From the detailed examination of crystallographic structures of different CFPs and GFPs, we conclude that these improvements stem from a shift in the thermodynamic balance between two well defined configurations of the residue 65 hydroxyl. These two configurations differ in their relative stabilization of a rigid chromophore, as well as in relaying the effects of Glu222 protonation at acid pHs. Our results suggest a simple method to greatly improve numerous FRET reporters used in cell imaging, and bring novel insights into the general structure-photophysics relationships of fluorescent proteins.},

  abstract = {Serial crystallography (SX) has become an established technique for protein structure determination, especially when dealing with small or radiation-sensitive crystals and investigating fast or irreversible protein dynamics. The advent of newly developed multi-megapixel X-ray area detectors, capable of capturing over 1000 images per second, has brought about substantial benefits. However, this advancement also entails a notable increase in the volume of collected data. Today, up to 2 PB of data per experiment could be easily obtained under efficient operating conditions. The combined costs associated with storing data from multiple experiments provide a compelling incentive to develop strategies that effectively reduce the amount of data stored on disk while maintaining the quality of scientific outcomes. Lossless data-compression methods are designed to preserve the information content of the data but often struggle to achieve a high compression ratio when applied to experimental data that contain noise. Conversely, lossy compression methods offer the potential to greatly reduce the data volume. Nonetheless, it is vital to thoroughly assess the impact of data quality and scientific outcomes when employing lossy compression, as it inherently involves discarding information. The evaluation of lossy compression effects on data requires proper data quality metrics. In our research, we assess various approaches for both lossless and lossy compression techniques applied to SX data, and equally importantly, we describe metrics suitable for evaluating SX data quality.},

  abstract = {An understanding of radiation damage effects suffered by biological samples during structural analysis using both X-rays and electrons is pivotal to obtain reliable molecular models of imaged molecules. This special issue on radiation damage contains six papers reporting analyses of damage from a range of biophysical imaging techniques. For X-ray diffraction, an in-depth study of multi-crystal small-wedge data collection single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing protocols is presented, concluding that an absorbed dose of 5 MGy per crystal was optimal to allow reliable phasing. For small-angle X-ray scattering, experiments are reported that evaluate the efficacy of three radical scavengers using a protein designed to give a clear signature of damage in the form of a large conformational change upon the breakage of a disulfide bond. The use of X-rays to induce OH radicals from the radiolysis of water for X-ray footprinting are covered in two papers. In the first, new developments and the data collection pipeline at the NSLS-II high-throughput dedicated synchrotron beamline are described, and, in the second, the X-ray induced changes in three different proteins under aerobic and low-oxygen conditions are investigated and correlated with the absorbed dose. Studies in XFEL science are represented by a report on simulations of ultrafast dynamics in protic ionic liquids, and, lastly, a broad coverage of possible methods for dose efficiency improvement in modalities using electrons is presented. These papers, as well as a brief synopsis of some other relevant literature published since the last Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Special Issue on Radiation Damage in 2019, are summarized below.},

When combined with tools that initiate biological reactions within microcrystals, time-resolved serial crystallography allows the study of structural changes that occur during an enzyme catalytic reaction. Serial synchrotron X-ray crystallography (SSX), which extends serial crystallography methods to synchrotron radiation sources, is expanding the scientific community using serial diffraction methods. This report presents a simple flow cell that can be used to deliver microcrystals across an X-ray beam during SSX studies. This device consists of an X-ray transparent glass capillary mounted on a goniometer-compatible 3D-printed support and is connected to a syringe pump via lightweight tubing. This flow cell is easily mounted and aligned, and it is disposable so can be rapidly replaced when blocked. This system was demonstrated by collecting SSX data at MAX IV Laboratory from microcrystals of the integral membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, from which an X-ray structure was determined to 2.12 Å resolution. This simple SSX platform may help to lower entry barriers for non-expert users of SSX.},

  abstract = {The rational engineering of photosensor proteins underpins the field of optogenetics, in which light is used for spatiotemporal control of cell signaling. Optogenetic elements function by converting electronic excitation of an embedded chromophore into structural changes on the microseconds to seconds time scale, which then modulate the activity of output domains responsible for biological signaling. Using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy coupled with isotope labeling, we have mapped the structural evolution of the LOV2 domain of the flavin binding phototropin Avena sativa (AsLOV2) over 10 decades of time, reporting structural dynamics between 100 fs and 1 ms after optical excitation. The transient vibrational spectra contain contributions from both the flavin chromophore and the surrounding protein matrix. These contributions are resolved and assigned through the study of four different isotopically labeled samples. High signal-to-noise data permit the detailed analysis of kinetics associated with the light activated structural evolution. A pathway for the photocycle consistent with the data is proposed. The earliest events occur in the flavin binding pocket, where a subpicosecond perturbation of the protein matrix occurs. In this perturbed environment, the previously characterized reaction between triplet state isoalloxazine and an adjacent cysteine leads to formation of the adduct state; this step is shown to exhibit dispersive kinetics. This reaction promotes coupling of the optical excitation to successive time-dependent structural changes, initially in the β-sheet and then α-helix regions of the AsLOV2 domain, which ultimately gives rise to Jα-helix unfolding, yielding the signaling state. This model is tested through point mutagenesis, elucidating in particular the key mediating role played by Q513.},

However, it is inevitable that more high-profile biological drug targets will be identified for which high-quality, highly homogenous crystal systems cannot be found. With increasing heterogeneity in crystal systems, the application of current multi-data-set methods becomes ever less sensitive to bound ligands. In order to ease the bottleneck of finding a well behaved crystal system, pre-clustering of data sets can be carried out using cluster4x after data collection to separate data sets into smaller partitions in order to restore the sensitivity of multi-data-set methods. Here, the software cluster4x is introduced for this purpose and validated against published data sets using PanDDA, showing an improved total signal from existing ligands and identifying new hits in both highly heterogenous and less heterogenous multi-data sets. cluster4x provides the researcher with an interactive graphical user interface with which to explore multi-data set experiments.},

  abstract = {Research towards using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) data to solve structures using experimental phasing methods such as sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) has been hampered by shortcomings in the diffraction models for X-ray diffraction from FELs. Owing to errors in the orientation matrix and overly simple partiality models, researchers have required large numbers of images to converge to reliable estimates for the structure-factor amplitudes, which may not be feasible for all biological systems. Here, data for cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus type 17 (CPV17) collected at 1.3 Å wavelength at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) are revisited. A previously published definition of a partiality model for reflections illuminated by self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) pulses is built upon, which defines a fraction between 0 and 1 based on the intersection of a reflection with a spread of Ewald spheres modelled by a super-Gaussian wavelength distribution in the X-ray beam. A method of post-refinement to refine the parameters of this model is suggested. This has generated a merged data set with an overall discrepancy (by calculating the Rsplit value) of 3.15\% to 1.46 Å resolution from a 7225-image data set. The atomic numbers of C, N and O atoms in the structure are distinguishable in the electron-density map. There are 13 S atoms within the 237 residues of CPV17, excluding the initial disordered methionine. These only possess 0.42 anomalous scattering electrons each at 1.3 Å wavelength, but the 12 that have single predominant positions are easily detectable in the anomalous difference Fourier map. It is hoped that these improvements will lead towards XFEL experimental phase determination and structure determination by sulfur SAD and will generally increase the utility of the method for difficult cases.},

On the other hand, shots from both X-ray free-electron lasers and serial synchrotron crystallography experiments are still images, in which the few three-dimensional data available arise only from the curvature of the Ewald sphere. Traditional synchrotron crystallography methods are thus less well suited to still image data processing. Here, a new indexing method is presented with the aim of maximizing information use from a still image given the known unit-cell dimensions and space group. Efficacy for cubic, hexagonal and orthorhombic space groups is shown, and for those showing some evidence of diffraction the indexing rate ranged from 90\% (hexagonal space group) to 151\% (cubic space group). Here, the indexing rate refers to the number of lattices indexed per image.},

However, the description of molecular flexibility is instrinsically flawed and in almost all cases, regardless of the experimental method used for structure determination, there remains a strong overfitting bias during molecular model building and refinement. In the worst case this can lead to wholly incorrect structures and thus incorrect biological interpretations. Here, by reparametrizing the description of these complex structures in terms of bonds rather than atomic positions, and by modelling flexibility using a deterministic ensemble of structures, it is demonstrated that structures can be described using fewer parameters than in conventional refinement. The current implementation, applied to X-ray diffraction data, significantly reduces the extent of overfitting, allowing the experimental data to reveal more biological information in electron-density maps.},

  abstract = {In this work, we experimentally investigate the allosteric transitions between conformational states on the Ras oncogene protein using high pressure crystallography. Ras protein is a small GTPase involved in central regulatory processes occurring in multiple conformational states. Ras acts as a molecular switch between active GTP-bound, and inactive GDP-bound states, controlling essential signal transduction pathways. An allosteric network of interactions between the effector binding regions and the membrane interacting regions is involved in Ras cycling. The conformational states which coexist simultaneously in solution possess higher Gibbs free energy than the ground state. Equilibria between these states can be shifted by applying pressure favouring conformations with lower partial molar volume, and has been previously analyzed by high-pressure NMR spectroscopy. High-pressure macromolecular crystallography (HPMX) is a powerful tool perfectly complementary to high-pressure NMR, allowing characterization at the molecular level with a high resolution the different allosteric states involved in the Ras cycling. We observe a transition above 300 MPa in the crystal leading to more stable conformers. Thus, we compare the crystallographic structures of Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GppNHp and Ras(D33K)·Mg2+·GppNHp at various high hydrostatic pressures. This gives insight into per-residue descriptions of the structural plasticity involved in allosteric equilibria between conformers. We have mapped out at atomic resolution the different segments of Ras protein which remain in the ground-state conformation or undergo structural changes, adopting excited-energy conformations corresponding to transient intermediate states. Such in crystallo phase transitions induced by pressure open the possibility to finely explore the structural determinants related to switching between Ras allosteric sub-states without any mutations nor exogenous partners.},

We address challenges to megahertz SFX for membrane protein complexes, including growth of large quantities of crystals and the large molecular and unit cell size that influence data collection and analysis.

The popular, but modestly bright, Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein (ECFP) was sequentially improved into the brighter variants Super Cyan Fluorescent Protein 3A (SCFP3A) and mTurquoise, the latter exhibiting a high-fluorescence quantum yield and a long mono-exponential fluorescence lifetime. Here we combine X-ray crystallography and excited-state calculations to rationalize these stepwise improvements. The enhancement originates from stabilization of the seventh β-strand and the strengthening of the sole chromophore-stabilizing hydrogen bond. The structural analysis highlighted one suboptimal internal residue, which was subjected to saturation mutagenesis combined with fluorescence lifetime-based screening. This resulted in mTurquoise2, a brighter variant with faster maturation, high photostability, longer mono-exponential lifetime and the highest quantum yield measured for a monomeric fluorescent protein. Together, these properties make mTurquoise2 the preferable cyan variant of green fluorescent protein for long-term imaging and as donor for Förster resonance energy transfer to a yellow fluorescent protein.},

  abstract = {Cyan fluorescent proteins (CFPs) are variants of green fluorescent proteins in which the central tyrosine of the chromophore has been replaced by a tryptophan. The increased bulk of the chromophore within a compact protein and the change in the positioning of atoms capable of hydrogen bonding have made it difficult to optimize their fluorescence properties, which took approximately 15 years between the availability of the first useable CFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), and that of a variant with almost perfect fluorescence efficiency, mTurquoise2. To understand the molecular bases of the progressive improvement in between these two CFPs, we have studied by incoherent neutron scattering the dynamics of five different variants exhibiting progressively increased fluorescence efficiency along the evolution pathway. Our results correlate well with the analysis of the previously determined X-ray crystallographic structures, which show an increase in flexibility between ECFP and the second variant, Cerulean, which is then hindered in the three later variants, SCFP3A (Super Cyan Fluorescent Protein 3A), mTurquoise and mTurquoise2. This confirms that increasing the rigidity of the direct environment of the fluorescent chromophore is not the sole parameter leading to brighter fluorescent proteins and that increased flexibility in some cases may be helpful.},

Other membrane proteins function as receptors and are responsible for molecular recognition of hormones and neurotransmitters. In spite of strong efforts, it is extremely difficult to crystallize these proteins and only a few different integral membrane proteins have been crystallized so far (2) and modeled at high resolution (seehttp://www.mpibpfrankfurt.mpg.de/michel/public/memprotstruct.html). Even in the case of water soluble proteins, for which good approaches to crystallization have been established, considerable efforts are necessary to search for the proper crystallization conditions by screening over a wide range of different parameters (pH, ionic strength, precipitants, protein concentration, etc.). In the case of membrane proteins, one faces even greater problems. Membrane proteins are amphiphilic in nature; in order to be solubilized the use of detergents is inevitable. A major obstacle to overcome is finding the detergent that preserves the stability of the protein. Unfortunately, “what seems to be suited for crystallization of membrane proteins is less suited for their stability” (3).},

  abstract = {Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) is a novel tool in structural biology. In contrast to conventional crystallography, SFX relies on merging partial intensities acquired with X-ray beams of often randomly fluctuating properties from a very large number of still diffraction images of generally randomly oriented microcrystals. For this reason, and possibly due to limitations of the still evolving data-analysis programs, XFEL-derived SFX data are typically of a lower quality than `standard' crystallographic data. In contrast with this, the studies performed at XFELs often aim to investigate issues that require precise high-resolution data, for example to determine structures of intermediates at low occupancy, which often display very small conformational changes. This is a potentially dangerous combination and underscores the need for a critical evaluation of procedures including data-quality standards in XFEL-based structural biology. Here, such concerns are addressed.},

An XFEL beam striking such a jet may launch supersonic shock waves up the jet, compromising the oncoming sample. To investigate this efficiently, we employed a novel XFEL pulse pattern to nominally expose the sample to between zero and four shock waves before being probed. Analyzing hit rate, indexing rate, and resolution for diffraction data recorded at MHz pulse rates, we found no evidence of damage. Notably, however, this conclusion could only be drawn after careful identification and assimilation of numerous interrelated experimental factors, which we describe in detail. Failure to do so would have led to an erroneous conclusion. Femtosecond photography of the sample-carrying jet revealed critically different jet behavior from that of all homogeneous liquid jets studied to date in this manner.},

The concept integrates several innovative approaches, such as chemically compatible mixes of potential ligands, new buffer systems and precipitant mixes that also act as cryoprotectants. Instead of gathering a set of crystallization conditions that have already been successful, a selection of molecules frequently observed in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to co-crystallize with proteins has been made. These have been put together in mixes of similar chemical behaviour and structure, and combined with buffers and precipitant mixes that were also derived from PDB searches, to build the screen de novo. Observations made at~the MRC-LMB and many practical aspects were also taken into account when formulating the screen.~The resulting screen is easy to use, comprehensive yet small, and has already yielded a list of crystallization hits using both known and novel samples. As an indicator of success, the screen has now become one of the standard screens used routinely at the MRC-LMB when searching initial crystallization conditions for biological macromolecules.},

This first-generation CFP was superseded by the popular Cerulean, CyPet, and SCFP3A that were engineered by rational and random mutagenesis, yet the latter CFPs still exhibit suboptimal properties of pH sensitivity and reversible photobleaching behavior. These flaws were serendipitously corrected in the third-generation CFP mTurquoise and its successors without an obvious rationale. We show here that the evolution process had unexpectedly remodeled the chromophore environment in second-generation CFPs so they would accommodate a different isomer, whose formation is favored by acidic pH or light irradiation and which emits fluorescence much less efficiently. Our results illustrate how fluorescent protein engineering based solely on fluorescence efficiency optimization may affect other photophysical or physicochemical parameters and provide novel insights into the rational evolution of fluorescent proteins with a tryptophan-based chromophore.},

Moreover, it is overexpressed in several tumors, which makes it an attractive cancer drug target. To decipher new structural insights into the flavin reductive half-reaction of the catalytic mechanism of hNQO1, we have carried serial crystallography experiments at new ID29 beamline of the ESRF to determine, to the best of our knowledge, the first structure of the hNQO1 in complex with NADH. We have also performed molecular dynamics simulations of free hNQO1 and in complex with NADH. This is the first structural evidence that the hNQO1 functional cooperativity is driven by structural communication between the active sites through long-range propagation of cooperative effects across the hNQO1 structure. Both structural results and MD simulations have supported that the binding of NADH significantly decreases protein dynamics and stabilizes hNQO1 especially at the dimer core and interface. Altogether, these results pave the way for future time-resolved studies, both at x-ray free-electron lasers and synchrotrons, of the dynamics of hNQO1 upon binding to NADH as well as during the FAD cofactor reductive half-reaction. This knowledge will allow us to reveal unprecedented structural information of the relevance of the dynamics during the catalytic function of hNQO1.},

  abstract = {Vision is initiated by the rhodopsin family of light-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1. A photon is absorbed by the 11-cis retinal chromophore of rhodopsin, which isomerizes within 200\,femtoseconds to the all-trans conformation2, thereby initiating the cellular signal~transduction processes that ultimately lead to vision. However, the intramolecular mechanism by which the photoactivated retinal induces the activation events inside rhodopsin remains experimentally unclear. Here we use ultrafast time-resolved crystallography at room temperature3 to determine how an isomerized twisted all-trans retinal stores the photon energy that is required to initiate the protein conformational changes associated with the formation of the G protein-binding signalling state. The distorted retinal at a 1-ps time delay after photoactivation has pulled away from half of its numerous interactions with its binding pocket, and the excess of the photon energy is released through an anisotropic protein breathing motion in the direction of the extracellular space. Notably, the very early structural motions in the protein side chains of rhodopsin appear in regions that are involved in later stages of the conserved class A GPCR activation mechanism. Our study sheds light on the earliest stages of vision in vertebrates and points to fundamental aspects of the molecular mechanisms of agonist-mediated GPCR activation.},

However, the microsecond spacing of MHz XFEL pulses raises new challenges, including possible sample damage induced by shock waves that are launched by preceding pulses~in the sample-carrying jet. We explored this matter with an X-ray-pump/X-ray-probe experiment employing haemoglobin microcrystals transported via~a liquid jet into the XFEL beam. Diffraction data were collected using a shock-wave-free single-pulse scheme as well as the dual-pulse pump-probe scheme. The latter, relative to the former, reveals significant degradation of crystal hit rate, diffraction resolution and data quality. Crystal structures extracted from the two data sets also differ. Since our pump-probe attributes were chosen to emulate EuXFEL operation at its 4.5\,MHz maximum pulse rate, this prompts concern about such data collection.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) enable novel experiments because of their high peak brilliance and femtosecond pulse duration. However, non-superconducting XFELs offer repetition rates of only 10–120\,Hz, placing significant demands on beam time and sample consumption. We describe serial femtosecond crystallography experiments performed at the European XFEL, the first MHz~repetition rate XFEL, delivering 1.128\,MHz X-ray pulse trains at 10\,Hz. Given the short spacing between pulses, damage caused by shock waves launched by one XFEL pulse on sample probed by subsequent pulses is a concern. To investigate this issue, we collected data from lysozyme microcrystals, exposed to a \textasciitilde 15\,μm XFEL beam. Under these conditions, data quality is independent of whether the first or subsequent pulses of the train were used for data collection. We also analyzed a mixture of microcrystals of jack bean proteins, from which the structure of native, magnesium-containing concanavalin A was determined.},

  abstract = {The discovery of light-inducible protein–protein interactions has allowed for the spatial and temporal control of a variety of biological processes. To be effective, a photodimerizer should have several characteristics: it should show a large change in binding affinity upon light stimulation, it should not cross-react with other molecules in the cell, and it should be easily used in a variety of organisms to recruit proteins of interest to each other. To create a switch that meets these criteria we have embedded the bacterial SsrA peptide in the C-terminal helix of a naturally occurring photoswitch, the light-oxygen-voltage 2 (LOV2) domain from Avena sativa. In the dark the SsrA peptide is sterically blocked from binding its natural binding partner, SspB. When activated with blue light, the C-terminal helix of the LOV2 domain undocks from the protein, allowing the SsrA peptide to bind SspB. Without optimization, the switch exhibited a twofold change in binding affinity for SspB with light stimulation. Here, we describe the use of computational protein design, phage display, and high-throughput binding assays to create an improved light inducible dimer (iLID) that changes its affinity for SspB by over 50-fold with light stimulation. A crystal structure of iLID shows a critical interaction between the surface of the LOV2 domain and a phenylalanine engineered to more tightly pin the SsrA peptide against the LOV2 domain in the dark. We demonstrate the functional utility of the switch through light-mediated subcellular localization in mammalian cell culture and reversible control of small GTPase signaling.},

The instrument consists of a deuterium lamp, optical fibres, a pair of mirror lenses and a monochromator equipped with a photodiode array detector. Spectra can be recorded in short periods of time (a few milliseconds) from a measurement area of 0.10 mm diameter or smaller. The device can be used to monitor spectral changes in crystals during time-resolved X-ray experiments so that the X-ray camera can be triggered at the right moment as determined by the spectrum, thereby eliminating much of the present guesswork from such studies.},

  abstract = {The term robustness in statistics refers to methods that are generally insensitive to deviations from model assumptions. In other words, robust methods are able to preserve their accuracy even when the data do not perfectly fit the statistical models. Robust statistical analyses are particularly effective when analysing mixtures of probability distributions. Therefore, these methods enable the discretization of X-ray serial crystallography data into two probability distributions: a group comprising true data points (for example the background intensities) and another group comprising outliers (for example Bragg peaks or bad pixels on an X-ray detector). These characteristics of robust statistical analysis are beneficial for the ever-increasing volume of serial crystallography (SX) data sets produced at synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources. The key advantage of the use of robust statistics for some applications in SX data analysis is that it requires minimal parameter tuning because of its insensitivity to the input parameters. In this paper, a software package called Robust Gaussian Fitting library (RGFlib) is introduced that is based on the concept of robust statistics. Two methods are presented based on the concept of robust statistics and RGFlib for two SX data-analysis tasks: (i) a robust peak-finding algorithm and (ii) an automated robust method to detect bad pixels on X-ray pixel detectors.},

  abstract = {Light sensing by photoreceptors controls phototropism, chloroplast movement, stomatal opening, and leaf expansion in plants. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which these processes are regulated requires a quantitative description of photoreceptor dynamics. We focus on a light-driven signal transduction mechanism in the LOV2 domain (LOV, light, oxygen, voltage) of the blue light photoreceptor phototropin 1 from Avena sativa (oat). High-resolution crystal structures of the dark and light states of an oat LOV2 construct including residues Leu404 through Leu546 (LOV2 (404-546)) have been determined at 105 and 293 K. In all four structures, LOV2 (404-546) exhibits the typical Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) fold, flanked by an additional conserved N-terminal turn-helix-turn motif and a C-terminal flanking region containing an amphipathic Jα helix. These regions dock on the LOV2 core domain and bury several hydrophobic residues of the central β-sheet of the core domain that would otherwise be exposed to solvent. Light structures of LOV2 (404-546) reveal that formation of the covalent bond between Cys450 and the C4a atom of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) results in local rearrangement of the hydrogen-bonding network in the FMN binding pocket. These rearrangements are associated with disruption of the Asn414-Asp515 hydrogen bond on the surface of the protein and displacement of the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of LOV2 (404-546), both of which constitute a structural signal.},

This is necessary in order to guide excitons to a reaction center, where their energy can drive a desired process. To reach this goal both of the following are required; short- and long-range structural order in the material and a detailed understanding of the excitonic transport. Here we present a strategy to realize crystalline chromophore assemblies with bespoke architecture. We demonstrate this approach by assembling anthracene dibenzoic acid chromophore into a highly anisotropic, crystalline structure using a layer-by-layer process. We observe two different types of photoexcited states; one monomer-related, the other excimer-related. By incorporating energy-accepting chromophores in this crystalline assembly at different positions, we demonstrate the highly anisotropic motion of the excimer-related state along the [010] direction of the chromophore assembly. In contrast, this anisotropic effect is inefficient for the monomer-related excited state.},

As well as small changes in many distances and a large improvement for Mg—Ocarboxylate, the table includes an indication of how reliable each prediction may be. Special attention was given to carboxylate interactions. When the carboxylate group is monodentate, the M—Ocarboxylate distance is well defined, but for bidentate carboxylate groups a wide range of distances is allowable; when the metal is Co, Cu or Zn the M—O1 and M—O2 distances are clearly inversely correlated; for the more purely electrostatic interactions involving Na, K and Ca there is a wider scatter of distances and little correlation.},

  abstract = {Phototropins are light-activated kinases from plants that utilize light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains as blue light photosensors. Illumination of these domains leads to the formation of a covalent linkage between the protein and an internally bound flavin chromophore, destabilizing the surrounding protein and displacing an α-helix from its surface. Here we use a combination of spectroscopic tools to monitor the kinetic processes that spontaneously occur in the dark as the protein returns to the noncovalent ground state. Using time-resolved two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods, we measured the rate of this process at over 100 independent sites throughout the protein, establishing that regeneration of the dark state occurs cooperatively within a 1.6-fold range of observed rates. These data agree with other spectroscopic measurements of the kinetics of protein/FMN bond cleavage and global conformational changes, consistent with these processes experiencing a common rate-limiting step. Arrhenius analyses of the temperature dependence of these rates suggest that the transition state visited during this regeneration has higher energy than the denatured form of this protein domain despite the fact that there is no global unfolding of the domain during this process.}

Previous studies indicated that phototropin uses a bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) within its light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain to generate a protein-flavin covalent bond under illumination. In the C-terminal LOV2 domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1, formation of this bond triggers a conformational change that results in unfolding of a helix external to this domain called Jα [Harper, S. M., et al. (2003) Science 301, 1541-1545]. Though the structural effects of illumination were characterized, it was unknown how these changes are coupled to kinase activation. To examine this, we made a series of point mutations along the Jα helix to disrupt its interaction with the LOV domain in a manner analogous to light activation. Using NMR spectroscopy and limited proteolysis, we demonstrate that several of these mutations displace the Jα helix from the LOV domain independently of illumination. When placed into the full-length phototropin protein, these point mutations display constitutive kinase activation, without illumination of the sample. These results indicate that unfolding of the Jα helix is the critical event in regulation of kinase signaling for the phototropin proteins.},

Light initiates signaling in these proteins by generating a covalent protein–flavin mononucleotide (FMN) adduct within sensory Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains. We characterized the light-dependent changes of a phototropin PAS domain by solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and found that an α helix located outside the canonical domain plays a key role in this activation process. Although this helix associates with the PAS core in the dark, photoinduced changes in the domain structure disrupt this interaction. We propose that this mechanism couples light-dependent bond formation to kinase activation and identifies a signaling pathway conserved among PAS domains.},

Phototropin blue light receptors (phot1 and phot2) optimize photosynthetic efficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana by coordinating multiple light-capturing processes. In this study, we explore the potential of using protein engineering to improve photoreceptor performance and thereby plant growth. We demonstrate that targeted mutagenesis can decrease or increase the photocycle lifetime of Arabidopsis phototropins in vitro and show that these variants can be used to reduce or extend the duration of photoreceptor activation in planta. Our findings show that slowing the phototropin photocycle enhanced several light-capturing responses, while accelerating it reduced phototropin’s sensitivity for chloroplast accumulation movement. Moreover, plants engineered to have a slow-photocycling variant of phot1 or phot2 displayed increased biomass production under low-light conditions as a consequence of their improved sensitivity. Together, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of engineering photoreceptors to manipulate plant growth and offer additional opportunities to enhance photosynthetic competence, particularly under suboptimal light regimes.},

Phototropins combine two blue-light-sensing Light–Oxygen–Voltage (LOV) domains (LOV1 and LOV2) and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain, using the LOV domains to control the catalytic activity of the kinase. While much is known about the structure and photochemistry of the light-perceiving LOV domains, particularly in how activation of the LOV2 domain triggers the unfolding of alpha helices that communicate the light signal to the kinase domain, many questions about phot structure and mechanism remain. Recent studies have made progress addressing these questions by utilizing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and other biophysical approaches to study multidomain phots from Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis, leading to models where the domains have an extended linear arrangement, with the regulatory LOV2 domain contacting the kinase domain N-lobe. We discuss this and other advances that have improved structural and mechanistic understanding of phot regulation in this review, along with the challenges that will have to be overcome to obtain high-resolution structural information on these exciting photoreceptors. Such information will be essential to advancing fundamental understanding of plant physiology while enabling engineering efforts at both the whole plant and molecular levels.},

At SPring-8, the feasibility of the fixed-target approach was examined by collecting data using a 2D raster scan combined with goniometer rotation. Results at cryogenic temperatures demonstrated that rotation is effective for efficient data collection in SSX and the method was named serial synchrotron rotation crystallography (SS-ROX). To use this method for room-temperature (RT) data collection, a humid air and glue-coating (HAG) method was developed in which data were collected from polyvinyl alcohol-coated microcrystals fixed on a loop under humidity-controlled air. The performance and the RT data-collection strategy for micro-crystallography were evaluated using microcrystals of lysozyme. Although a change in unit-cell dimensions of up to 1\% was observed during data collection, the impact on data quality was marginal. A comparison of data obtained at various absorbed doses revealed that absorbed doses of up to 210 kGy were tolerable in both global and local damage. Although this limits the number of photons deposited on each crystal, increasing the number of merged images improved the resolution. On the basis of these results, an equation was proposed that relates the achievable resolution to the total photon flux used to obtain a data set.},

Cloning of the cDNA and heterologous expression of fluorescent protein in a wide variety of organisms indicate that this unique posttranslational modification must be either spontaneous or dependent only on ubiquitous enzymes and reactants. We report that formation of the final fluorophore requires molecular oxygen and proceeds with a time constant (approximately 4 hr at 22 degrees C and atmospheric pO2) independent of dilution, implying that the oxidation does not require enzymes or cofactors. GFP was mutagenized and screened for variants with altered spectra. The most striking mutant fluoresced blue and contained histidine in place of Tyr-66. The availability of two visibly distinct colors should significantly extend the usefulness of GFP in molecular and cell biology by enabling in vivo visualization of differential gene expression and protein localization and measurement of protein association by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.},

The global pattern of electric-field-induced motions is consistent with both local and allosteric conformational changes naturally induced by ligand binding, including at conserved functional sites in the PDZ domain family.

  abstract = {Macromolecular crystallography is a well established method in the field of structural biology and has led to the majority of known protein structures to date. After focusing on static structures, the method is now under development towards the investigation of protein dynamics through time-resolved methods. These experiments often require multiple handling steps of the sensitive protein crystals, e.g. for ligand-soaking and cryo-protection. These handling steps can cause significant crystal damage, and hence reduce data quality. Furthermore, in time-resolved experiments based on serial crystallography, which use micrometre-sized crystals for short diffusion times of ligands, certain crystal morphologies with small solvent channels can prevent sufficient ligand diffusion. Described here is a method that combines protein crystallization and data collection in a novel one-step process. Corresponding experiments were successfully performed as a proof-of-principle using hen egg-white lysozyme and crystallization times of only a few seconds. This method, called JINXED (Just IN time Crystallization for Easy structure Determination), promises high-quality data due to the avoidance of crystal handling and has the potential to enable time-resolved experiments with crystals containing small solvent channels by adding potential ligands to the crystallization buffer, simulating traditional co-crystallization approaches.},

  abstract = {Phototropins are photoreceptor proteins that regulate blue light-dependent biological processes for efficient photosynthesis in plants and algae. The proteins consist of a photosensory domain that responds to the ambient light and an output module that triggers cellular responses. The photosensory domain of phototropin from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains two conserved LOV (light–oxygen–voltage) domains with flavin chromophores. Blue light triggers the formation of a covalent cysteine–flavin adduct and upregulates the phototropin kinase activity. Little is known about the structural mechanism that leads to kinase activation and how the two LOV domains contribute to this. Here, we investigate the role of the LOV1 domain from C.~reinhardtii phototropin by characterizing the structural changes occurring after blue light illumination with nano- to millisecond time-resolved X-ray solution scattering. By structurally fitting the data with atomic models generated by molecular dynamics simulations, we find that adduct formation induces a rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network from the buried chromophore to the protein surface. In particular, the change in conformation and the associated hydrogen bonding of the conserved glutamine 120 induce a global movement of the β-sheet, ultimately driving a change in the electrostatic potential on the protein surface. On the basis of the change in the electrostatics, we propose a structural model of how LOV1 and LOV2 domains interact and regulate the full-length phototropin from C. reinhardtii. This provides a rationale for how LOV photosensor proteins function and contributes to the optimal design of optogenetic tools based on LOV domains.},

Because data analysis necessarily begins with matrices, which are “noisy” at some level of precision, the chapter describes some of the properties of the SVD of matrices, which contain noise. It describes the SVD of random matrices (that is, matrices containing only noise). The chapter explores the way the random amplitudes are distributed in the SVD output when noise is added to a data matrix by using perturbation theory. The chapter discusses the significant advantages that result from the application of SVD and complementary processing techniques for the analysis of large sets of experimental data.},

  abstract = {We describe a general approach to the model-based analysis of sets of spectroscopic data that is built upon the techniques of matrix analysis. A model hypothesis may often be expressed by writing a matrix of measured spectra as the product of a matrix of spectra of individual molecular species and a matrix of corresponding species populations as a function of experimental conditions. The modeling procedure then requires the simultaneous determination of a set of species spectra and a set of model parameters (from which the populations are derived), such that this product yields an optimal description of the measured spectra. This procedure may be implemented as an optimization problem in the space of the (possibly nonlinear) model parameters alone, coupled with the efficient solution of a corollary linear optimization problem using matrix decomposition methods to obtain a set of species spectra corresponding to any set of model parameters. Known species spectra, as well as other information and assumptions about spectral shapes, may be incorporated into this general framework, using parametrized analytical functional forms and basis-set techniques. The method by which assumed relationships between global features (e.g., peak positions) of different species spectra may be enforced in the modeling without otherwise specifying the shapes of the spectra will be shown. We also consider the effect of measurement errors on this approach and suggest extensions of the matrix-based least-squares procedures applicable to situations in which measurement errors may not be assumed to be normally distributed. A generalized analysis procedure is introduced for cases in which the species spectra vary with experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {The calcium ion serves as a versatile and universal second messenger to control a myriad of biological processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, hormone secretion, immune cell activation, cell motility, and apoptosis [1–3]. The calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel mediated by ORAI and stromal interaction molecule (STIM) constitutes one of the primary Ca2+ entry routes in non-excitable cells [4–6] (see Chapter 2). The CRAC channel is regarded as a prototypical example of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), in which the depletion of Ca2+ store in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces calcium influx from the extracellular space. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made with respect to the critical steps required to activate SOCE (Figure 8.1) [5–7]. Under resting conditions, the STIM1 luminal EF-SAM domain is loaded with Ca2+ and exists largely as a monomer [8]. The STIM1 cytoplasmic domain (STIM1ct), consisting of a coiled-coil region (CC1), a minimal ORAI1-activating region (SOAR or CAD), and a C-terminal polybasic tail (PB), adopts a folded-back configuration that keeps itself inactive through autoinhibition [9,10]. Upon ER Ca2+ store depletion, dissociation of Ca2+ from the EF-SAM domain initiates a destabilization-coupled oligomerization process in the ER lumen [8]. Conformational changes in the canonical EF-hand Ca2+-binding motif disrupt the intramolecular interaction between the EF-hands and SAM domains, thereby causing aggregation of the luminal EF-SAM domains. The luminal domain oligomerization further triggers conformational changes that propagate throughout STIM1ct. STIM1ct redeploys itself and adopts a more extended conformation by exposing the SOAR/CAD domain, as well as the polybasic C-tail. Next, the activated STIM1 multimerizes and moves toward the ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctional sites, where it recruits and gates ORAI1 channels through direct physical association with ORAI1. This process is also facilitated by the interaction between its polybasic C-tail and the negatively charged phosphoinositides in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (see Chapters 2 and 3). Sustained Ca2+ influx through ORAI1 channels activates downstream effectors such as calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and triggers the nuclear translocation of NFAT to regulate gene expression during lymphocyte activation [4] (see Chapter 5). Two critical steps during SOCE activation, oligomerization of STIM1 luminal domain and conformational switch within STIM1ct, can be mimicked by photosensitive domains that undergo light-inducible oligomerization or allosteric regulation to devise photoactivatable CRAC channels (termed Opto-CRAC), thereby enabling remote and optical control of calcium signaling [11–13]. Compared to the existing microbial opsin-based optogenetic tools, Opto-CRAC has several distinctive features such as the following:Unlike the widely used channelrhodopsin (ChR)-based tools [14] that exhibit less stringent ion selectivity and tend to perturb intracellular pH due to their high proton permeability, Opto-CRAC is engineered from a bona fide Ca2+ channel that is regarded as one of the most Ca2+-selective ion channels (see Chapter 1). The Opto-CRAC tool is among the smallest optogenetic tools ({$<$}1 kb, compared to {$>$}2.2 kb of ChR) and is thus compatible with viral vectors used for in vivo gene delivery. Its tunable and relatively slow kinetics make Opto-CRAC most suitable for generating customized Ca2+ oscillation patterns in non-excitable cell types, such as cells of the immune and hematopoietic systems.In this chapter, we present a brief overview of the design principles of Opto-CRAC constructs based on two different photoresponsive domains (CRY2 and LOV2) and illustrate how to use them to remotely control Ca2+ influx with at high spatiotemporal precision and subsequent nuclear translocation of a master transcriptional factor, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), to fine-tune NFAT-dependent gene expression and control the function of immune cells.},

  abstract = {Aureochromes have been shown to act as blue-light-regulated transcription factors in algae in the absence of phototropins. Aureochromes comprise a light-, oxygen-, or voltage-sensitive (LOV) domain as a sensory module binding the flavin chromophore and a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain as an effector. The domain arrangement in aureochromes with an N-terminal effector is inversed to other LOV proteins. To clarify the role of the linking A′α helix in signaling, we have investigated the LOV domain of aureochrome1a from the diatom alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum without the N-terminal A′α helix but with the C-terminal Jα helix. Results were analyzed in comparison to those previously obtained on the LOV domain with both flanking helices and on the LOV domain with the A′α helix but without the Jα helix. Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy provides evidence by a band at 1656 cm–1 that the A′α helix unfolds in response to light. This unfolding takes place only in the presence and as a consequence of the unfolding of the Jα helix, which points to an allosteric regulation. Size exclusion chromatography shows the LOV domain to be dimeric in the absence and monomeric in the presence of the A′α helix, implying that the folded helix covers the dimerization site. Therefore, the A′α helix directly modulates the oligomerization state of the LOV domain, whereas the Jα helix acts as an allosteric regulator. Both the allosteric control and the light-induced dimerization have not been observed in phototropin-LOV2 and point to a different signaling mechanism within the full-length proteins.},

  abstract = {Aureochromes have recently been shown to act as blue-light-regulated transcription factors in the stramenopile alga Vaucheria frigida. They comprise a light-, oxygen-, or voltage-sensitive (LOV) domain as a sensory module with flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a chromophore and a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain as an effector. Aureochromes are the only members of a large LOV protein family, where the effector domain is located N-terminal to the sensor domain. This domain inversion positions the linking Jα helix of other LOV proteins to the terminus, raising the question of the role of Jα in aureochrome signaling. In phototropins, signaling proceeds from LOV2 via dissociation and unwinding of the Jα helix to the C-terminal kinase effector domain. In contrast, other LOV proteins have been demonstrated to activate the effector without the unfolding of Jα. We investigated the LOV domain of aureochrome1a from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum both with and without the Jα helix. Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy provides evidence that the Jα helix unfolds upon illumination. This unfolding is prerequisite for light-induced dimerization of LOV. Under illumination, full conversion to the dimer was observed by size exclusion chromatography. In the absence of the helix, a monomer was detected in the dark and in the light. As a further effect, the recovery of the dark state is 6-fold slower in LOV-Jα than LOV. We therefore postulate that the Jα helix plays an important role in aureochrome signaling.},

  abstract = {Serial electron diffraction (SerialED), which applies a snapshot data acquisition strategy for each crystal, was introduced to tackle the problem of radiation damage in the structure determination of beam-sensitive materials by three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). The snapshot data acquisition in SerialED can be realized using both transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopes (TEM/STEM). However, the current SerialED workflow based on STEM setups requires special external devices and software, which limits broader adoption. Here, we present a simplified experimental implementation of STEM-based SerialED on Thermo Fisher Scientific STEMs using common proprietary software interfaced through Python scripts to automate data collection. Specifically, we utilize TEM Imaging and Analysis (TIA) scripting and TEM scripting to access the STEM functionalities of the microscope, and DigitalMicrograph scripting to control the camera for snapshot data acquisition. Data analysis adapts the existing workflow using the software CrystFEL, which was developed for serial X-ray crystallography. Our workflow for STEM SerialED can be used on any Gatan or Thermo Fisher Scientific camera. We apply this workflow to collect high-resolution STEM SerialED data from two aluminosilicate zeolites, zeolite Y and ZSM-25. We demonstrate, for the first time, ab initio structure determination through direct methods using STEM SerialED data. Zeolite Y is relatively stable under the electron beam, and STEM SerialED data extend to 0.60 Å. We show that the structural model obtained using STEM SerialED data merged from 358 crystals is nearly identical to that using continuous rotation electron diffraction data from one crystal. This demonstrates that accurate structures can be obtained from STEM SerialED. Zeolite ZSM-25 is very beam-sensitive and has a complex structure. We show that STEM SerialED greatly improves the data resolution of ZSM-25, compared with serial rotation electron diffraction (SerialRED), from 1.50 to 0.90 Å. This allows, for the first time, the use of standard phasing methods, such as direct methods, for the ab initio structure determination of ZSM-25.},

  abstract = {The light-induced proton pump in bacteriorhodopsin is reviewed with emphasis on acid-base equilibria of protein residues and of the retinal Schiff base moiety. Pump mechanisms in bR and in some of its mutants are classified in terms of light-induced pKa changes (class I) or light-induced exposure changes, in which the proton accessibility of the protein changes from the outside to the inside of the membrane (class II). A discussion of the theoretical basis of the factors which determine the pKa of ionizable protein groups is followed by a review of the experimental phenomena associated with the titration of residues in both unphotolyzed bR and during its photocycle. The time-resolved titrations of the Schiff base and of the Asp-85 residue are discussed in terms of the accessibility of the two groups to external protons. Finally, the molecular aspects of the pH-dependent proton pump in native bR and in various mutants are analyzed, focusing on the mechanism of the initial proton release reaction and on the subsequent molecular switch which allows reprotonation from the inside of the cell. Special attention is devoted to the question of coupling between the photocycle intermediates (primary M formation and decay) and the transmembrane proton translocation. Recent work with bR mutants raise the question as to whether proton transfer from the Schiff base to Asp-85 at the M stage is directly responsible for proton translocation, as well as for the reprotonation switch.},

At ambient temperature the useful lifetime of these crystals under synchrotron irradiation is limited to a few minutes. However, upon cooling to cryogenic temperatures around 85 K, the original resolution limit (up to 4.5 A) can be recorded and radiation damage is virtually eliminated. Hence it has become possible to collect a complete data set from one single crystal. Crystals were cooled as rapidly as possible, either in a cold gas stream, or by immersion in liquid propane. Before cooling crystals were transferred either to an inert hydrocarbon environment, or to solutions similar to the crystallizing ones but with a higher viscosity.

  abstract = {Relating individual protein crystal structures to an enzyme mechanism remains a major and challenging goal for structural biology. Serial crystallography using multiple crystals has recently been reported in both synchrotron-radiation and X-ray free-electron laser experiments. In this work, serial crystallography was used to obtain multiple structures serially from one crystal (MSOX) to study in crystallo enzyme catalysis. Rapid, shutterless X-ray detector technology on a synchrotron MX beamline was exploited to perform low-dose serial crystallography on a single copper nitrite reductase crystal, which survived long enough for 45 consecutive 100 K X-ray structures to be collected at 1.07–1.62 Å resolution, all sampled from the same crystal volume. This serial crystallography approach revealed the gradual conversion of the substrate bound at the catalytic type 2 Cu centre from nitrite to nitric oxide, following reduction of the type 1 Cu electron-transfer centre by X-ray-generated solvated electrons. Significant, well defined structural rearrangements in the active site are evident in the series as the enzyme moves through its catalytic cycle, namely nitrite reduction, which is a vital step in the global denitrification process. It is proposed that such a serial crystallography approach is widely applicable for studying any redox or electron-driven enzyme reactions from a single protein crystal. It can provide a `catalytic reaction movie' highlighting the structural changes that occur during enzyme catalysis. The anticipated developments in the automation of data analysis and modelling are likely to allow seamless and near-real-time analysis of such data on-site at some of the powerful synchrotron crystallographic beamlines.},

The substrate-bound crystal structure of oNBTyrRS at a 2.79 Å resolution indicated that the replacement of tyrosine and leucine at positions 32 and 65 by glycine (Tyr32Gly and Leu65Gly, respectively) and Asp158Ser created sufficient space for entry of the bulky substitute into the amino acid binding pocket, while Glu in place of Leu162 formed a hydrogen bond with the nitro moiety of oNBTyr. We also produced an oNBTyr-containing lysozyme through a cell-free protein synthesis system derived from the Escherichia coli B95. ΔA strain with the UAG codon reassigned to the nonnatural amino acid. Another crystallographic study of the caged protein showed that the site-specifically incorporated oNBTyr was degraded to tyrosine by light irradiation of the crystals.

To address how CraCRY stabilizes the physiologically relevant redox state of FAD, we investigated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the two-electron reduced anionic FAD state (FADH-) in CraCRY and related (6–4) photolyases. The thermodynamic stability of FADH- remained almost the same compared to that of all tested proteins. However, the kinetic stability of FADH- varied remarkably depending on the local structure of the secondary pocket, where an auxiliary chromophore, 8-hydroxy-7,8-didemethyl-5-deazariboflavin (8-HDF), can be accommodated. The observed effect of 8-HDF uptake on the enhancement of the kinetic stability of FADH- suggests an essential role of 8-HDF in the bifunctionality of CraCRY.},

Conical intersections are funnels connecting otherwise separate potential energy surfaces. Posited almost a century ago1, conical intersections remain the subject of intense scientific interest2–5. In biology, they have a pivotal role in vision, photosynthesis and DNA stability6. Accurate theoretical methods for examining conical intersections are at present limited to small molecules. Experimental investigations are challenged by the required time resolution and sensitivity. Current structure-dynamical understanding of conical intersections is thus limited to simple molecules with around ten atoms, on timescales of about 100\,fs or longer7. Spectroscopy can achieve better time resolutions8, but provides indirect structural information. Here we present few-femtosecond, atomic-resolution videos of photoactive yellow protein, a 2,000-atom protein, passing through a conical intersection. These videos, extracted from experimental data by machine learning, reveal the dynamical trajectories of de-excitation via a conical intersection, yield the key parameters of the conical intersection controlling the de-excitation process and elucidate the topography of the electronic potential energy surfaces involved.},

A high-resolution 1.89\,Å structure obtained by averaging all the S states and refining the data of various time points during the S2 to S3 transition has provided better visualization of the potential pathways for substrate water insertion and proton release. Our results indicate that the O1 channel is the likely water intake pathway, and the Cl1 channel is the likely proton release pathway based on the structural rearrangements of water molecules and amino acid side chains along these channels. In particular in the Cl1 channel, we suggest that residue D1-E65 serves as a gate for proton transport by minimizing the back reaction. The results show that the water oxidation reaction at the OEC is well coordinated with the amino acid side chains and the H-bonding network over the entire length of the channels, which~is essential in shuttling substrate waters and protons.},

The well-known latitudinal gradient of species diversity reaches its maximum in tropical rain forests, which are considered to be the most productive ecosystems on the planet. However, this high tropical productivity on land is the opposite of the well-documented distribution of marine productivity, which is greatest in the high-latitude oceans around the poles. This paradox can be resolved by a reevaluation of the terrestrial productivity gradient. Compilations of direct measurements of forest NPP show that annual NPP in tropical forests is no different than annual NPP in temperate forests, contrary to recent syntheses and to the output of global vegetation models. Other properties of forest ecosystems, such as basal area of trees, wood density, and the ratio of wood to leaf production, as well as animal properties such as body size, population density, and reproductive rates, support the conclusion that ecologically relevant terrestrial productivity is actually highest in the temperate latitudes, reaching a maximum between 30° and 50° before declining toward the poles. This “reversal” of the latitudinal productivity gradient, if substantiated by a systematic global sampling effort, will necessitate a major reevaluation of ecological and evolutionary theory, as well as conservation strategies and international development policies.},

The structural dynamics that result from femtosecond optical excitation have contributions from vibrational and electronic processes and from reaction dynamics that involve the crossing through a conical intersection. The creation and progression of the ultrafast structural dynamics strongly depends on optical and molecular parameters. When using X-ray crystallography as a probe of ultrafast dynamics, the origin of the observed nuclear motions is not known. Now, high-resolution pump–probe X-ray crystallography reveals complex sub-ångström, ultrafast motions and hydrogen-bonding rearrangements in the active site of a fluorescent protein. However, we demonstrate that the measured motions are not part of the photoisomerization reaction but instead arise from impulsively driven coherent vibrational processes in the electronic ground state. A coherent-control experiment using a two-colour and two-pulse optical excitation strongly amplifies the X-ray crystallographic difference density, while it fully depletes the photoisomerization process. A coherent control mechanism was tested and confirmed the wave packets assignment.},

The femtosecond pump-probe application of protein crystallography represents a new experimental regime that provides an X-ray structural probe for coherent processes that were previously accessible primarily using ultrafast spectroscopy. We address how the optical regime of the visible pump, that is necessary to successfully resolve ultrafast structural differences, affects the motions that are measured using the technique. The sub-picosecond photochemical dynamics in PYP involves evolution of a mixture of electronic ground and excited state populations. Additional to photoisomerisation that is considered to proceed through activated barrier crossing, within the dephasing time structural motion include vibrational coherence arising from excited states, the ground state and a ground state intermediate under experimental conditions used for ultrafast crystallography. Intense optical pulses are required to convert population levels in PYP crystals that allow detection by X-ray crystallography, but the compromise currently needed for the optical bandwidth and power has consequences with regard to the contributions to the motions that are experimentally measured with femtosecond delays. We briefly review the ultrafast spectroscopy literature of the primary photoreactions of PYP and discuss relevant physical models taken from coherent control and femtosecond coherence spectroscopy literature that address both the population transfer as well as the vibrational coherences. We apply linear response theory, with the additional use of a high power approximation, of on-resonance impulsive vibrational coherence in the ground state and the non-impulsive coherence in the excited state and discuss experimental approaches to manipulate the coherence contributions. The results are generalised and extended to discuss the future capabilities of high repetition rate X-ray free electron laser instruments providing enhanced sensitivity to perform the crystallographic equivalent of an impulsive Raman measurement of vibrational coherence.},

  abstract = {In photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) is the multi-subunit membrane protein complex that catalyzes photo-oxidation of water into dioxygen through the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). To understand the water oxidation reaction, it is important to get structural information about the transient and intermediate states of the OEC in the dimeric PSII core complex (dPSIIcc). In recent times, femtosecond X-ray pulses from the free electron laser (XFEL) are being used to obtain X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of dPSIIcc microcrystals at room temperature that are free of radiation damage. In our experiments at the XFEL, we used an electrospun liquid microjet setup that requires microcrystals less than 40 μm in size. In this study, we explored various microseeding techniques to get a high yield of monodisperse uniform-sized microcrystals. Monodisperse microcrystals of dPSIIcc of uniform size were a key to improve the stability of the jet and the quality of XRD data obtained at the XFEL. This was evident by an improvement of the quality of the datasets obtained, from 6.5\,Å, using crystals grown without the micro seeding approach, to 4.5\,Å using crystals generated with the new method.},

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis, light-driven oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is carried out by the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PS II). Recently, we reported the room-temperature structures of PS II in the four (semi)stable S-states, S1, S2, S3, and S0, showing that a water molecule is inserted during the S2 → S3 transition, as a new bridging O(H)-ligand between Mn1 and Ca. To understand the sequence of events leading to the formation of this last stable intermediate state before O2 formation, we recorded diffraction and Mn X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) data at several time points during the S2 → S3 transition. At the electron acceptor site, changes due to the two-electron redox chemistry at the quinones, QA and QB, are observed. At the donor site, tyrosine YZ and His190 H-bonded to it move by 50 µs after the second flash, and Glu189 moves away from Ca. This is followed by Mn1 and Mn4 moving apart, and the insertion of OX(H) at the open coordination site of Mn1. This water, possibly a ligand of Ca, could be supplied via a “water wheel”-like arrangement of five waters next to the OEC that is connected by a large channel to the bulk solvent. XES spectra show that Mn oxidation (τ of ∼350 µs) during the S2 → S3 transition mirrors the appearance of OX electron density. This indicates that the oxidation state change and the insertion of water as a bridging atom between Mn1 and Ca are highly correlated.},

  abstract = {Determining 3D intermediate structures during the biological action of proteins in real time under ambient conditions is essential for understanding how proteins function. Here we use time-resolved Laue crystallography to extract short-lived intermediate structures and thereby unveil signal transduction in the blue light photoreceptor photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila. By analyzing a comprehensive set of Laue data during the PYP photocycle (forty-seven time points from one nanosecond to one second), we track all atoms in PYP during its photocycle and directly observe how absorption of a blue light photon by its p-coumaric acid chromophore triggers a reversible photocycle. We identify a complex chemical mechanism characterized by five distinct structural intermediates. Structural changes at the chromophore in the early, red-shifted intermediates are transduced to the exterior of the protein in the late, blue-shifted intermediates through an initial “volume-conserving” isomerization of the chromophore and the progressive disruption of hydrogen bonds between the chromophore and its surrounding binding pocket. These results yield a comprehensive view of the PYP photocycle when seen in the light of previous biophysical studies on the system.},

  abstract = {Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are autophosphorylating blue-light receptor kinases that mediate blue-light responses such as phototropism, chloroplast accumulation, and stomatal opening in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Only phot2 induces the chloroplast avoidance response under strong blue light. The serine (Ser) residues of the kinase activation loop in phot1 are autophosphorylated by blue light, and autophosphorylation is essential for the phot1-mediated responses. However, the role of autophosphorylation in phot2 remains to be determined. In this study, we substituted the conserved residues of Ser-761 and Ser-763 with alanine (S761A S763A) in the phot2 activation loop and analyzed their function by investigating the phot2-mediated responses after the transformation of phot1 phot2 double mutant with this mutant phot2 gene. Transgenic plants expressing the mutant phot2 protein exhibited impaired responses in chloroplast movement, stomatal opening, phototropic bending, leaf flattening, and plant growth; and those expressing phot2 with S761D S763D mutations showed the normal responses. Substitution of both Ser-761 and Ser-763 with alanine in phot2 did not significantly affect the kinase activity in planta. From these results, we conclude that phosphorylation of Ser-761 and Ser-763 in the activation loop may be a common primary step for phot2-mediated responses.},

The GIXD diffraction pattern was modeled with two coexisting lattice arrangements, suggesting structural flexibility exhibited in the multiple ways by which β-strands and their amino acid side chains pack into ordered 2-D structures. Here, we find by in-situ GIXD measurements that the ordered β-sheet assemblies may undergo a quasi-reversible compression and expansion cycle at the air-water interface. The diffraction measurements indicate that on compression the repeat distance that corresponds to the long axes of the peptide strands may decrease by up to 37\% in length. Upon expansion the compressed β-sheet assemblies revert elastically to their original conformation. The interstrand repeat distance along the peptide hydrogen bonds apparently does not change along the film compression and expansion. Based on the GIXD data, at surface pressures higher than ∼3 mN/m, beyond the peptide limiting area per molecule, the compressibility is 7.4 ± 0.6 m/N. The out-of-plane Bragg rod diffraction patterns imply that in the compressed state the β-strands buckle up in reaction to the increase in surface pressure. At low surface pressure, the 2-D compressibility of the crystalline β-sheet was estimated at ∼32 m/N attributed to interdomain rearrangements.},

  abstract = {Light-activated protein domains provide a convenient, modular, and genetically encodable sensor for optogenetics and optobiology. Although these domains have now been deployed in numerous systems, the precise mechanism of photoactivation and the accompanying structural dynamics that modulate output domain activity remain to be fully elucidated. In the C-terminal light–oxygen–voltage (LOV) domain of plant phototropins (LOV2), blue light activation leads to formation of an adduct between a conserved Cys residue and the embedded FMN chromophore, rotation of a conserved Gln (Q513), and unfolding of a helix (Jα-helix) which is coupled to the output domain. In the present work, we focus on the allosteric pathways leading to Jα helix unfolding in Avena sativa LOV2 (AsLOV2) using an interdisciplinary approach involving molecular dynamics simulations extending to 7 μs, time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, solution NMR spectroscopy, and in-cell optogenetic experiments. In the dark state, the side chain of N414 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone N–H of Q513. The simulations predict a lever-like motion of Q513 after Cys adduct formation resulting in a loss of the interaction between the side chain of N414 and the backbone C═O of Q513, and formation of a transient hydrogen bond between the Q513 and N414 side chains. The central role of N414 in signal transduction was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis supporting a direct link between Jα helix unfolding dynamics and the cellular function of the Zdk2-AsLOV2 optogenetic construct. Through this multifaceted approach, we show that Q513 and N414 are critical mediators of protein structural dynamics, linking the ultrafast (sub-ps) excitation of the FMN chromophore to the microsecond conformational changes that result in photoreceptor activation and biological function.},

  abstract = {Cryptochromes (Crys) and photolyases (Phrs) are flavoproteins that contain an identical cofactor (flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD) within the same protein architecture but whose physiological functions are entirely different. In this study, we investigated light-induced conformational changes of a cyanobacterium Cry/Phr-like protein (SCry-DASH) with UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. We developed a system for measuring light-induced difference spectra under the concentrated conditions. In the presence of a reducing agent, SCry-DASH showed photoreduction to the reduced form, and we identified a signal unique for an anionic form in the process. Difference FTIR spectra enabled us to assign characteristic FTIR bands to the respective redox forms of FAD. An asparagine residue, which anchors the FAD embedded within the protein, is conserved not only in the cyanobaterial protein but also in Phrs and other Crys, including the mammalian clock-related Crys. By characterizing an asparagine-to-cysteine (N392C) mutant of SCry-DASH, which mimics an insect specific Cry, we identified structural changes of the carbonyl group of this conserved asparagine upon light irradiation. We also found that the N392C mutant is stabilized in the anionic form. We did not observe a signal from protonated carboxylic acid residues during the reduction process, suggesting that the carboxylic acid moiety would not be directly involved as a proton donor to FAD in the system. These results are in contrast to plant specific Crys represented by Arabidopsis thaliana Cry1 that carry Asp at the position. We discuss potential roles for this conserved asparagine position and functional diversity in the Cry/Phr frame.},

  abstract = {Phototropin (Phot) is a blue-light receptor in plants. The molecule has two FMN (flavin mononucleotide) binding domains named LOV (light-, oxygen-, and voltage-sensing), which is a subset of the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) superfamily. Illumination of the phot-LOV domains in the dark state (D447) produces a covalent C(4a) flavin-cysteinyl adduct (S390) via a triplet excited state (L660), which reverts to D447 in the dark. In this work, we studied the light-induced structural changes in the LOV2 domain of Adiantum phytochrome3 (phy3), which is a fusion protein of phot containing the phytochrome chromophoric domain, by low-temperature UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy. UV-visible spectroscopy detected only one intermediate state, S390, in the temperature range from 77 to 295 K, indicating that the adduct is produced even at temperatures as low as 77 K, although a portion of D447 cannot be converted to S390 at low temperatures possibly because of motional freezing. In the whole temperature range, FTIR spectra in the S-H stretching frequency region showed that Cys966 of phy3-LOV2 is protonated in D447 and unprotonated on illumination, supporting adduct formation. The pKa of the S-H group in D447 is estimated to be {$>$}10. FTIR spectra also showed the light-induced appearance of a positive peak around 3621 cm-1 in the whole temperature range, indicating that adduct formation accompanies rearrangement of a hydrogen bond of a water molecule(s), which can be either water25, water45, or both, near the chromophore. In contrast to the weak temperature dependence of the spectral changes in the UV-visible absorption and the FTIR of both S-H and O-H stretching bands, light-induced changes in the amide I vibration that probes protein backbone structure vary significantly with the increase in temperature. The spectral changes suggest that light excitation of FMN loosens the local structure around it, particularly in turns, in the early stages and that another change subsequently takes place to tighten it, mainly in β-structure, but some occur in the α-helical structure of the protein moiety as well. Interestingly, these changes proceed without altering the shape of UV-visible spectra, suggesting the presence of multiple conformation states in S390.},

A series of experiments using the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin have further established these injectors as a preferred option to deliver crystals for time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) to resolve structural changes of proteins after photoactivation. To obtain multiple structural snapshots of high quality, it is essential to collect large amounts of data and ensure clearance of crystals between every pump laser pulse. Here, we describe in detail how we optimized the extrusion of bacteriorhodopsin microcrystals for our recent TR-SFX experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The goal of the method is to optimize extrusion for a stable and continuous flow while maintaining a high density of crystals to increase the rate at which data can be collected in a TR-SFX experiment. We achieve this goal by preparing lipidic cubic phase with a homogenous distribution of crystals using a novel threeway syringe coupling device followed by adjusting the sample composition based on measurements of the extrusion stability taken with a highspeed camera setup. The methodology can be adapted to optimize the flow of other microcrystals. The setup will be available for users of the new Swiss Free Electron Laser facility.},

  abstract = {Protein X-ray crystallography recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. The structures of myoglobin and hemoglobin determined by Kendrew and Perutz provided the first glimpses into the complex protein architecture and chemistry. Since then, the field of structural molecular biology has experienced extraordinary progress and now more than 55000 protein structures have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank. In the past decade many advances in macromolecular crystallography have been driven by world-wide structural genomics efforts. This was made possible because of third-generation synchrotron sources, structure phasing approaches using anomalous signal, and cryo-crystallography. Complementary progress in molecular biology, proteomics, hardware and software for crystallographic data collection, structure determination and refinement, computer science, databases, robotics and automation improved and accelerated many processes. These advancements provide the robust foundation for structural molecular biology and assure strong contribution to science in the future. In this report we focus mainly on reviewing structural genomics high-throughput X-ray crystallography technologies and their impact.},

LPCs possess extremely high solvent content, as well as extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Because of these characteristics, LPCs continue to be explored in diverse applications including catalysis, targeted therapeutic delivery, templating of nanostructures, structural biology.

In this respect an understanding of the effect of solution conditions on macromolecule nucleation rates is advantageous. This study investigated the effects of supersaturation, temperature, and pH on the nucleation rate of tetragonal lysozyme crystals. Batch crystallization plates were prepared at given solution concentrations and incubated at set temperatures over 1 week. The number of crystals per well with their size and axial ratios were recorded and correlated with solution conditions. Crystal numbers were found to increase with increasing supersaturation and temperature. The most significant variable, however, was pH; crystal numbers changed by two orders of magnitude over the pH range 4.0–5.2. Crystal size also varied with solution conditions, with the largest crystals obtained at pH 5.2. Having optimized the crystallization conditions, we prepared a batch of crystals under the same initial conditions, and 50 of these crystals were analyzed by x-ray diffraction techniques. The results indicate that even under the same crystallization conditions, a marked variation in crystal properties exists.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {Trans-to-cis isomerization, the key reaction in photoactive proteins, usually cannot occur through the standard one-bond-flip mechanism. Owing to spatial constraints imposed by a protein environment, isomerization probably proceeds through a volume-conserving mechanism in which highly choreographed atomic motions are expected, the details of which have not yet been observed directly. Here we employ time-resolved X-ray crystallography to visualize structurally the isomerization of the p-coumaric acid chromophore in photoactive yellow protein with a time resolution of 100 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.6~Å. The structure of the earliest intermediate (IT) resembles a highly strained transition state in which the torsion angle is located halfway between the trans- and cis-isomers. The reaction trajectory of IT bifurcates into two structurally distinct cis intermediates via hula-twist and bicycle-pedal pathways. The bifurcating reaction pathways can be controlled by weakening the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and an adjacent residue through E46Q mutation, which switches off the bicycle-pedal pathway.},

  abstract = {Light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains are increasingly used to engineer photoresponsive biological systems. While the photochemical cycle is well documented, the allosteric mechanism by which formation of a cysteinyl-flavin adduct leads to activation is unclear. Via replacement of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) with 5-deazaflavin mononucleotide (5dFMN) in the Aureochrome1a (Au1a) transcription factor from Ochromonas danica, a thermally stable cysteinyl-5dFMN adduct was generated. High-resolution crystal structures ({$<$}2 Å) under different illumination conditions with either FMN or 5dFMN chromophores reveal three conformations of the highly conserved glutamine 293. An allosteric hydrogen bond network linking the chromophore via Gln293 to the auxiliary A′α helix is observed. With FMN, a “flip” of the Gln293 side chain occurs between dark and lit states. 5dFMN cannot hydrogen bond through the C5 position and proved to be unable to support Au1a domain dimerization. Under blue light, the Gln293 side chain instead “swings” away in a conformation distal to the chromophore and not previously observed in existing LOV domain structures. Together, the multiple side chain conformations of Gln293 and functional analysis of 5dFMN provide new insight into the structural requirements for LOV domain activation.},

Here, we review recent shifts in our understanding of how to use data quality indicators to select a high resolution cutoff that leads to the best model, and of the potential to greatly increase data quality through the merging of multiple measurements from multiple passes of single crystals or from multiple crystals. Key factors supporting this shift are the introduction of more robust correlation coefficient based indicators of the precision of merged data sets as well as the recognition of the substantial useful information present in extensive amounts of data once considered too weak to be of value.},

  abstract = {Phototropins (phot1 and phot2, formerly designated nph1 and npl1) are blue-light receptors that mediate phototropism, blue light-induced chloroplast relocation, and blue light-induced stomatal opening in Arabidopsis. Phototropins contain two light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains at their N termini (LOV1 and LOV2), each a binding site for the chromophore flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Their C termini contain a serine/threonine protein kinase domain. Here, we examine the kinetic properties of the LOV domains of Arabidopsis phot1 and phot2, rice (Oryza sativa) phot1 and phot2, andChlamydomonas reinhardtii phot. When expressed inEscherichia coli, purified LOV domains from all phototropins examined bind FMN tightly and undergo a self-contained photocycle, characterized by fluorescence and absorption changes induced by blue light (T. Sakai, T. Kagawa, M. Kasahara, T.E. Swartz, J.M. Christie, W.R. Briggs, M. Wada, K. Okada [2001] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 6969–6974; M. Salomon, J.M. Christie, E. Knieb, U. Lempert, W.R. Briggs [2000] Biochemistry 39: 9401–9410). The photocycle involves the light-induced formation of a cysteinyl adduct to the C(4a) carbon of the FMN chromophore, which subsequently breaks down in darkness. In each case, the relative quantum efficiencies for the photoreaction and the rate constants for dark recovery of LOV1, LOV2, and peptides containing both LOV domains are presented. Moreover, the data obtained from full-length Arabidopsis phot1 and phot2 expressed in insect cells closely resemble those obtained for the tandem LOV-domain fusion proteins expressed in E. coli. For both Arabidopsis and rice phototropins, the LOV domains of phot1 differ from those of phot2 in their reaction kinetic properties and relative quantum efficiencies. Thus, in addition to differing in amino acid sequence, the phototropins can be distinguished on the basis of the photochemical cycles of their LOV domains. The LOV domains ofC. reinhardtii phot also undergo light-activated spectral changes consistent with cysteinyl adduct formation. Thus, the phototropin family extends over a wide evolutionary range from unicellular algae to higher plants.},

As a consequence, organisms possess different kinds of light-sensing photoreceptors to regulate their physiological variables and adapt to a given habitat. The cryptochrome/photolyase family (CPF) includes photoreceptors that perform different functions in different organisms. Photolyases repair ultraviolet-induced DNA damage by a process known as photoreactivation using photons absorbed from the blue end of the light spectrum. On the other hand, cryptochromes act as blue light circadian photoreceptors in plants and Drosophila to regulate growth and development. In mammals, cryptochromes have light-independent functions and are very important transcriptional regulators that act at the molecular level as negative transcriptional regulators of the circadian clock. In this review, we highlight current knowledge concerning the structural and functional relationships of CPF members.},

  abstract = {While native SAD phasing is a promising method for next-generation macromolecular crystallography, it requires the collection of high-quality diffraction data using long-wavelength X-rays. The crystal itself and the noncrystalline medium around the crystal can cause background noise during long-wavelength X-ray data collection, hampering native SAD phasing. Optimizing the crystal size and shape or removing noncrystalline sample portions have thus been considered to be effective means of improving the data quality. A crystal-processing machine that uses a deep-UV laser has been developed. The machine utilizes the pulsed UV laser soft ablation (PULSA) technique, which generates less heat than methods using infrared or visible lasers. Since protein crystals are sensitive to heat damage, PULSA is an appropriate method to process them. Integration of a high-speed Galvano scanner and a high-precision goniometer enables protein crystals to be shaped precisely and efficiently. Application of this crystal-processing machine to a long-wavelength X-ray diffraction experiment significantly improved the diffraction data quality and thereby increased the success rate in experimental phasing using anomalous diffraction from atoms.},

  abstract = {Determining the interconverting conformations of dynamic proteins in atomic detail is a major challenge for structural biology. Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function, but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA, confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above, yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model, in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network. Together, our multitemperature analyses and XFEL data motivate a new generation of temperature- and time-resolved experiments to structurally characterize the dynamic underpinnings of protein function.},

Bernal and Dorothy Hodgkin (then Dorothy Crowfoot) showed [Bernal, J. D. \& Crowfoot, D. Nature 133, 794–795 (1934)] that proteins, when crystallized, would diffract X-rays to produce a complex pattern of spots. They knew that these patterns contained all the information needed to determine a protein–s structure but, frustratingly, that information could not be deciphered. By comparing patterns from crystals containing different heavy-metal atoms, Max Perutz and colleagues devised the approach that was to solve this riddle. In 1958, J. C. Kendrew et al. applied Perutz–s technique to produce the first three-dimensional images of any protein - myoglobin, the protein used by muscles to store oxygen.},

  abstract = {The phototropins constitute an important class of plant photoreceptor kinases that control a range of physiological responses, including phototropism, light-directed chloroplast movement, and light-induced stomatal opening. The LOV2 domain of phototropin binds a molecule of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and undergoes a photocycle involving light-driven covalent adduct formation between a conserved cysteine residue and the C(4a) atom of FMN. This product state promotes C-terminal kinase activation and downstream signal transduction. Here, we report the primary photophysics and photochemistry of LOV2 domains of phototropin 1 of Avena sativa (oat) and of the phy3 photoreceptor of Adiantum capillus-veneris (maidenhair fern). In agreement with earlier reports [Swartz, T. E., et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 36493-36500], we find that the FMN triplet state is the reactive species from which the photoreaction occurs. We demonstrate that the triplet state is the primary photoproduct in the LOV2 photocycle, generated at 60\% efficiency. No spectroscopically distinguishable intermediates precede the FMN triplet on the femtosecond to nanosecond time scale, indicating that it is formed directly via intersystem crossing (ISC) from the singlet state. Our results indicate that the majority of the FMN triplets in the LOV2 domain exist in the protonated form. We propose a reaction mechanism that involves excited-state proton transfer, on the nanosecond time scale or faster, from the sulfhydryl group of the conserved cysteine to the N5 atom of FMN. This event promotes adduct formation by increasing the electrophilicity of C(4a) and subsequent nucleophilic attack by the cysteine's thiolate anion. Comparison to free FMN in solution shows that the protein environment of LOV2 increases the ISC rate of FMN by a factor of 2.4, thus improving the yield of the cysteinyl-flavin adduct and the efficiency of phototropin-mediated signaling processes.},

  abstract = {Acoustic levitation has attracted attention in terms of chemical and biochemical analysis in combination with various analytical methods because of its unique container-less environment for samples that is not reliant on specific material characteristics. However, loading samples with very high viscosity is difficult. To expand the scope, we propose the use of polymer thin films as sample holders, whereby the sample is dispensed on a film that is subsequently loaded onto an acoustic levitator. When applied for protein crystallography experiments, rotation controllability and positional stability are important prerequisites. We therefore study the acoustic levitation and rotation of thin films with an aspect ratio (the diameter-to-thickness ratio) of 80–240, which is an order of magnitude larger than those reported previously. For films with empirically optimized shapes, we find that it is possible to control the rotation speed in the range of 1–4 rotations per second while maintaining a positional stability of 12\,±\,5~µm. The acoustic radiation force acting on the films is found to be a factor of 26–30 higher than that for same-volume water droplets. We propose use cases of the developed films for protein crystallography experiments and demonstrate data collections for large single crystal samples at room temperature.},

  abstract = {Most of the dioxygen on earth is generated by the oxidation of water by photosystem II (PS~II) using light from the sun. This light-driven, four-photon reaction is catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5 cluster located at the lumenal side of PS~II. Various X-ray studies have been carried out at cryogenic temperatures to understand the intermediate steps involved in the water oxidation mechanism. However, the necessity for collecting data at room temperature, especially for studying the transient steps during the O–O bond formation, requires the development of new methodologies. In this paper we report room temperature X-ray diffraction data of PS~II microcrystals obtained using ultrashort ({$<~$}50~fs) 9~keV X-ray pulses from a hard X-ray free electron laser, namely the Linac Coherent Light Source. The results presented here demonstrate that the ”probe before destroy” approach using an X-ray free electron laser works even for the highly-sensitive Mn4CaO5 cluster in PS~II at room temperature. We show that these data are comparable to those obtained in synchrotron radiation studies as seen by the similarities in the overall structure of the helices, the protein subunits and the location of the various cofactors. This work is, therefore, an important step toward future studies for resolving the structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster without any damage at room temperature, and of the reaction intermediates of PS~II during O–O bond formation.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the period-four oscillation in flash-induced oxygen evolution of photosystem II discovered by Joliot in 1969, Kok performed additional experiments and proposed a five-state kinetic model for photosynthetic oxygen evolution, known as Kok’s S-state clock or cycle1,2. The model comprises four (meta)stable intermediates (S0, S1, S2 and S3) and one transient S4 state, which precedes dioxygen formation occurring in a concerted reaction from two water-derived oxygens bound at an oxo-bridged tetra manganese calcium (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex3–7. This reaction is coupled to the two-step reduction and protonation of the mobile plastoquinone QB at the acceptor side of PSII. Here, using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and simultaneous X-ray emission spectroscopy with multi-flash visible laser excitation at room temperature, we visualize all (meta)stable states of Kok’s cycle as high-resolution structures (2.04–2.08~Å). In addition, we report structures of two transient states at 150 and 400~µs, revealing notable structural changes including the binding of one additional ‘water’, Ox, during the S2→S3 state transition. Our results suggest that one water ligand to calcium (W3) is directly involved in substrate delivery. The binding of the additional oxygen Ox in the S3 state between Ca and Mn1 supports O–O bond formation mechanisms involving O5 as one substrate, where Ox is either the other substrate oxygen or is perfectly positioned to refill the O5 position during O2 release. Thus, our results exclude peroxo-bond formation in the S3 state, and the nucleophilic attack of W3 onto W2 is unlikely.},

The spectra show that the initial O–O bond formation, coupled to Mn reduction, does not yet occur within 250\,μs after the third flash. Diffraction data of all states studied exhibit an anomalous scattering signal from Mn but show no significant structural changes at the present resolution of 4.5\,Å.

  abstract = {Macromolecular crystallography has historically provided the atomic structures of proteins fundamental to cellular functions. However, the advent of cryo-electron microscopy for structure determination of large and increasingly smaller and flexible proteins signaled a paradigm shift in structural biology. The extensive structural and sequence data from crystallography and advanced sequencing techniques have been pivotal for training computational models for accurate structure prediction, unveiling the general fold of most proteins. Here, we present a perspective on the rise of time-resolved crystallography as the new frontier of macromolecular structure determination. We trace the evolution from the pioneering time-resolved crystallography methods to modern serial crystallography, highlighting the synergy between rapid detection technologies and state-of-the-art x-ray sources. These innovations are redefining our exploration of protein dynamics, with high-resolution crystallography uniquely positioned to elucidate rapid dynamic processes at ambient temperatures, thus deepening our understanding of protein functionality. We propose that the integration of dynamic structural data with machine learning advancements will unlock predictive capabilities for protein kinetics, revolutionizing dynamics like macromolecular crystallography revolutionized structural biology.},

  abstract = {Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is a powerful technique that uses X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL) to determine structures of biomolecular complexes. Specifically, it benefits the study of atomic resolution structures of large membrane protein complexes and time-resolved reactions with crystallography. One major drawback of SFX studies with XFELs is the consumption of large amounts of a protein crystal sample to collect a complete X-ray diffraction data set for high-resolution crystal structures. This increases the time and resources required for sample preparation and experimentation. The intrinsic pulsed nature of all current X-ray sources is a major reason why such large amounts of sample are required. Any crystal sample that is delivered in the path of the X-ray beam during its “off-time” is wasted. To address this large sample consumption issue, we developed a 3D printed microfluidic system with integrated metal electrodes for water-in-oil droplet generation to dynamically create and manipulate aqueous droplets. We demonstrate on-demand droplet generation using DC potentials and the ability to tune the frequency of droplet generation through the application of AC potentials. More importantly, to assist with the synchronization of droplets and XFEL pulses, we show that the device can induce a phase shift in the base droplet generation frequency. This novel approach to droplet generation has the potential to reduce sample waste by more than 95\% for SFX experiments with XFELs performed with liquid jets and can operate under low- and high-pressure liquid injection systems.},

Further truncation of up to 11 amino acids resulted in partial impairment in maximal fluorescence. The GFP fluorescence was completely disrupted when more than 12 amino acids were deleted out of the C-terminal.

Methanosarcina mazei Mm0852 is a class II photolyase of the archaeal order of Methanosarcinales, and is closely related to plant and metazoan counterparts. Mm0852 catalyses light‐driven DNA repair and photoreduction, but in contrast to class I enzymes lacks a high degree of binding discrimination between UV‐damaged and intact duplex DNA. We solved crystal structures of Mm0852, the first one for a class II photolyase, alone and in complex with CPD lesion‐containing duplex DNA. The lesion‐binding mode differs from other photolyases by a larger DNA‐binding site, and an unrepaired CPD lesion is found flipped into the active site and recognized by a cluster of five water molecules next to the bound 3′‐thymine base. Different from other members of the photolyase‐cryptochrome family, class II photolyases appear to utilize an unusual, conserved tryptophane dyad as electron transfer pathway to the catalytic FAD cofactor.},

Here we report the direct observation of nuclear motion in a complex biological system, the retinal chromophore of bacteriorhodopsin (bR568)4, as it undergoes the trans–cis photoisomerization that is fundamental to the vision process. By using visible-light pulses of less than 5\,femtosecond in duration5,6, we are able to monitor changes in the vibrational spectra of the transition state and thus show that despite photoexcitation of the anti-bonding molecular orbital involved, isomerization does not occur instantly, but involves transient formation of a so-called ‘tumbling state’. Our observations thus agree with growing experimental7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 and ab~initio evidence15,16 for a three-state photoisomerization model8,9,10,17 and firmly discount the initially suggested two-state model18,19,20 for this process.},

  abstract = {Phototropins mediate various blue-light responses such as phototropism, chloroplast relocation, stomatal opening and leaf flattening in plants. Phototropins are hydrophilic chromoproteins that are mainly bound to the plasma membrane. One of two phototropins in Arabidopsis thaliana, phot2, associates with the Golgi apparatus in a light-dependent manner. In this study, we analyzed the biological activities of the N-terminal photosensory and C-terminal kinase domains of phot2. For this purpose, these domains were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and ectopically expressed in the wild-type and a phot1 phot2 double mutant of Arabidopsis. The kinase domain fused to GFP (P2CG) was localized to the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, whereas the photosensory domain fused to GFP (P2NG) was uniformly localized in the cytosol. Hence, the kinase domain rather than the photosensory domain is responsible for the membrane association. Interestingly, the P2CG plants exhibited constitutive blue-light responses even in dark conditions, i.e. stomata were open and chloroplasts were in the avoidance position. By contrast, P2CG with a mutation that abolishes the kinase activity (P2C[D720/N]G) failed to exhibit these responses. phot2 kinase is therefore suggested to be correctly localized to functional sites in the cell and to trigger light signal transduction through its kinase activity. In contrast to P2CG, P2NG did not affect the phot2 responses, except for partial inhibition of the phototropic response caused by the endogenous phototropins.},

  abstract = {Femtosecond time-resolved crystallography (TRC) on proteins enables resolving the spatial structure of short-lived photocycle intermediates. An open question is whether confinement and lower hydration of the proteins in the crystalline state affect the light-induced structural transformations. Here, we measured the full photocycle dynamics of a signal transduction protein often used as model system in TRC, Photoactive Yellow Protein (PYP), in the crystalline state and compared those to the dynamics in solution, utilizing electronic and vibrational transient absorption measurements from 100\,fs over 12 decades in time. We find that the photocycle kinetics and structural dynamics of PYP in the crystalline form deviate from those in solution from the very first steps following photon absorption. This illustrates that ultrafast TRC results cannot be uncritically extrapolated to in vivo function, and that comparative spectroscopic experiments on proteins in crystalline and solution states can help identify structural intermediates under native conditions.},

  abstract = {Light-triggered reactions of biological photoreceptors have gained immense attention for their role as molecular switches in their native organisms and for optogenetic application. The light, oxygen, and voltage 2 (LOV2) sensing domain of plant phototropin binds a C-terminal Jα helix that is docked on a β-sheet and unfolds upon light absorption by the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore. In this work, the signal transduction pathway of LOV2 from Avena sativa was investigated using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy from picoseconds to microseconds. In D2O buffer, FMN singlet-to-triplet conversion occurs in 2 ns and formation of the covalent cysteinyl-FMN adduct in 10 μs. We observe a two-step unfolding of the Jα helix: The first phase occurs concomitantly with Cys-FMN covalent adduct formation in 10 μs, along with hydrogen-bond rupture of the FMN C4═O with Gln-513, motion of the β-sheet, and an additional helical element. The second phase occurs in approximately 240 μs. The final spectrum at 500 μs is essentially identical to the steady-state light-minus-dark Fourier transform infrared spectrum, indicating that Jα helix unfolding is complete on that time scale.},

  abstract = {The photocycle in photoactive yellow protein (PYP) crystals was studied by single-crystal absorption spectroscopy with experimental setups for low-temperature and time-resolved measurements. Thin and flat PYP crystals, suitable for light absorption studies, were obtained using special crystallization conditions. Illumination of PYP crystals at 100 K led to the formation of a photostationary state, which includes at least one hypsochromic and one bathochromic photoproduct that resemble PYPH and PYPB, respectively. The effect of temperature, light color and light pulse duration on the occupancy of these low-temperature photoproducts was determined and appeared similar to that observed in solution. At room temperature a blueshifted photocycle intermediate was identified that corresponds to the blueshifted state of PYP (pB). Kinetic studies show that the decay of this blueshifted intermediate is biphasic at -12°C and 15-fold faster than that observed in solution at room temperature. These altered pB decay kinetics confirm a model that holds that the photocycle in crystals takes place in a shortcut version. In this version the key structural events of the photocycle, such as photoisomerization and reversible protonation of the chromophore, take place, but large conformational changes in the surrounding protein are limited by constraints imposed by the crystal lattice.},

  abstract = {DNA photolyase is a unique flavoenzyme that repairs UV-induced DNA lesions using the energy of visible light. Anacystis nidulans photolyase contains a light-harvesting chromophore, 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which, in contrast to the 8-HDF chromophore, is indispensable for catalytic activity. This work reports the crystallization and structure at 1.8 Å resolution of DNA photolyase devoid of its 8-HDF chromophore (apophotolyase). The overall three-dimensional structure is similar to that of the holoenzyme, indicating that the presence of 8-HDF is not essential for the correct folding of the enzyme. Structural changes include an additional phosphate group, a different conformation for Arg11 and slight rearrangements of Met47, Asp101 and Asp382, which replace part of the 8-HDF molecule in the chromophore-binding pocket. The apophotolyase can be efficiently reconstituted with synthetic 8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin, despite the orientation of Arg11 and the presence of the phosphate group in the 8-HDF pocket. Red light or X-rays reduced the FAD chromophore in apophotolyase crystals, as observed by single-crystal spectrophotometry. The structural effects of FAD reduction were determined by comparison of three data sets that were successively collected at 100 K, while the degree of reduction was monitored online by changes in the light absorption of the crystals. X-ray-induced conformational changes were confined to the active site of the protein. They include sub-ångström movements of the O(2) and N(5) atoms of the flavin group as well as the Oδ atoms of the surrounding amino acids Asp380 and Asn386.},

Cofactors such as retinals, linear tetrapyrroles, and 4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid have been selected by nature that provide the essential double bond to transduce the light signal into a conformational change and eventually, a physiological response. Here we report the first events after light excitation of the latter chromophore, containing a single ethylene double bond, in a low temperature crystallographic study of the photoactive yellow protein. We measured experimental phases to overcome possible model bias, corrected for minimized radiation damage, and measured absorption spectra of crystals to analyze the photoproducts formed. The data show a mechanism for the light activation of photoactive yellow protein, where the energy to drive the remainder of the conformational changes is stored in a slightly strained but fully \emph{cis}-chromophore configuration. In addition, our data indicate a role for backbone rearrangements during the very early structural events.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The initial output of a time-resolved macromolecular crystallography experiment is a time-dependent series of difference electron density maps that displays the time-dependent changes in underlying structure as a reaction progresses. The goal is to interpret such data in terms of a small number of crystallographically refinable, time-independent structures, each associated with a reaction intermediate; to establish the pathways and rate coefficients by which these intermediates interconvert; and thereby to elucidate a chemical kinetic mechanism. One strategy toward achieving this goal is to use cluster analysis, a statistical method that groups objects based on their similarity. If the difference electron density at a particular voxel in the time-dependent difference electron density (TDED) maps is sensitive to the presence of one and only one intermediate, then its temporal evolution will exactly parallel the concentration profile of that intermediate with time. The rationale is therefore to cluster voxels with respect to the shapes of their TDEDs, so that each group or cluster of voxels corresponds to one structural intermediate. Clusters of voxels whose TDEDs reflect the presence of two or more specific intermediates can also be identified. From such groupings one can then infer the number of intermediates, obtain their time-independent difference density characteristics, and refine the structure of each intermediate. We review the principles of cluster analysis and clustering algorithms in a crystallographic context, and describe the application of the method to simulated and experimental time-resolved crystallographic data for the photocycle of photoactive yellow protein.},

Here we present a comprehensive function-structure study of a light-driven bacterial inward proton pump, xenorhodopsin, from Bacillus coahuilensis in all major proton-conducting states. The structures reveal that proton translocation is based on proton wires regulated by internal gates. The wires serve as both selectivity filters and translocation pathways for protons. The cumulative results suggest a general concept of proton translocation. We demonstrate the use of serial time-resolved crystallography at a synchrotron source with sub-millisecond resolution for rhodopsin studies, opening the door for principally new applications. The results might also be of interest for optogenetics since xenorhodopsins are the only alternative tools to fire neurons.},

  abstract = {Phototropins (phot) are blue light receptors in plants which are involved in phototropism, stomatal opening, and chloroplast movements. Phototropin has two LOV domains (LOV1 and LOV2), and the LOV2 domain is responsible for activation of Ser/Thr kinase. There is an α-helix at the C-terminal side of the LOV2 domain, which is called the Jα helix. The functional importance of the Jα helix has been established for Arabidopsis phot1, where light-induced structural perturbation takes place in the Jα helix during the photocycle of LOV2 domains. However, the present FTIR study reports a different role of the Jα helix in light-induced signal transduction of LOV2 domains. Here we construct LOV2 domains with (LOV-Jα) and without (LOV-core) the Jα helix for Arabidopsis phot1 and phot2 and Adiantum neochrome 1 and compare their light-induced difference FTIR spectra. Light-induced protein structural changes differ significantly between LOV-Jα and LOV-core for Arabidopsis phot1 [Yamamoto, A., Iwata, T., Sato, Y., Matsuoka, D., Tokutomi, S., and Kandori, H. (2009) Biophys. J. 96, 2771-2778]. In contrast, the difference spectra are identical between LOV-Jα and LOV-core for Adiantum neochrome 1. In Arabidopsis phot2, the protein structural changes are intermediate between Arabidopsis phot1 and Adiantum neochrome 1. These results suggest that the conformational changes of the Jα helix and the interaction between the LOV-core and the Jα helix are different among phototropins. The role of the Jα helix for signal transduction in phototropins is discussed.},

  abstract = {Three problems involving heat transfer from a protein crystal to a cooling agent are analyzed: flash-cooling in a cold nitrogen- or helium-gas stream, plunge-cooling into liquid nitrogen, propane or ethane and crystal heating in a cold gas stream owing to X-ray absorption. Heat transfer occurs by conduction inside the crystal and by convection from the crystal's outer surface to the cooling fluid. For flash-cooling in cold gas streams, heat transfer is limited by the rate of external convection; internal temperature gradients and crystal strains during cooling are very small. Helium gas provides only a threefold improvement in cooling rates relative to nitrogen because its much larger thermal conductivity is offset by its larger kinematic viscosity. Characteristic cooling times vary with crystal size L as L3/2 and theoretical estimates of these times are consistent with experiments. Plunge-cooling into liquid cryogens, which can give much smaller convective thermal resistances provided that surface boiling is eliminated, can increase cooling rates by more than an order of magnitude. However, the internal conduction resistance is no longer negligible, producing much larger internal temperature gradients and strains that may damage larger crystals. Based on this analysis, factors affecting the success of flash-cooling experiments can be ordered from most to least important as follows: (1) crystal solvent content and solvent composition, (2) crystal size and shape, (3) amount of residual liquid around the crystal, (4) cooling method (liquid plunge versus gas stream), (5) choice of gas/liquid and (6) relative speed between cooling fluid and crystal. Crystal heating by X-ray absorption on present high-flux beamlines should be small. For a fixed flux and illuminated area, heating can be reduced by using crystals with areas normal to the beam that are much larger than the beam area.},

  abstract = {Many important biochemical processes occur on the time-scales of nanoseconds and microseconds. The introduction of the laser temperature-jump (T-jump) to biophysics more than a decade ago opened these previously inaccessible time regimes up to direct experimental observation. Since then, laser T-jump methodology has evolved into one of the most versatile and generally applicable methods for studying fast biomolecular kinetics. This perspective is a review of the principles and applications of the laser T-jump technique in biophysics. A brief overview of the T-jump relaxation kinetics and the historical development of laser T-jump methodology is presented. The physical principles and practical experimental considerations that are important for the design of the laser T-jump experiments are summarized. These include the Raman conversion for generating heating pulses, considerations of size, duration and uniformity of the temperature jump, as well as potential adverse effects due to photo-acoustic waves, cavitation and thermal lensing, and their elimination. The laser T-jump apparatus developed at the NIH Laboratory of Chemical Physics is described in detail along with a brief survey of other laser T-jump designs in use today. Finally, applications of the laser T-jump in biophysics are reviewed, with an emphasis on the broad range of problems where the laser T-jump methodology has provided important new results and insights into the dynamics of the biomolecular processes.},

  abstract = {Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) at X-ray Free electron Lasers (XFELs) is a relatively new field promising to deliver unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution on biological systems and there dynamics. Over the past decade, though, there have been a handful of results that have truly delivered on these promises. Why? SFX has many paradigm shifting techniques not seen in typical structural biology arenas, such as creating a concentrated slurry of microcrystals rather than a handful of loopable prisms worthy of a catalog photo. Then taking that slurry and high speed jetting them towards the vacuum or helium interation region to destroy less than 1\% of your sample and waste the other 99. The literature is full of techniques and methods promising to cure what ails your experiment, yet as an instrument scientist will tell you –and a first author might admit after a few drinks at the conference happy hour—is that there are a lot more failures than the success we published, results may vary. We will walk through a best practices on how to prepare your sample and chose a sample delivery technique that will amerliorate your studies rather than undermine your hardwork and hopefully lead to better experimental planning and execution, inching you closer to that scientific goal and that call from Stockholm. This will be written in a more editorialized fashion and is meant to give the reader an idea of what to try or how they should be thinking. Welcome to SFX, now what?},

  abstract = {LOV domains are the light sensitive parts of phototropins and many other light-activated enzymes that regulate the response to blue light in plants and algae as well as some fungi and bacteria. Unlike all other biological photoreceptors known so far, the photocycle of LOV domains involves the excited triplet state of the chromophore. This chromophore is flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which forms a covalent adduct with a cysteine residue in the signaling state. Since the formation of this adduct from the triplet state involves breaking and forming of two bonds as well as a change from the triplet to the singlet spin state, various intermediates have been proposed, e.g. a protonated triplet state 3FMNH+, the radical anion 2FMN˙-, or the neutral semiquinone radical 2FMNH˙. We performed an extensive search for these intermediates by two-dimensional transient absorption (2D-TA) with a streak camera. However, no transient with a rate constant between the decay of fluorescence and the decay of the triplet state could be detected. Analysis of the decay associated difference spectra results in quantum yields for the formation of the adduct from the triplet of ΦA(LOV1) ≈ 0.75 and ΦA(LOV2) ≈ 0.80. This is lower than the values ΦA(LOV1) ≈ 0.95 and ΦA(LOV2) ≈ 0.99 calculated from the rate constants, giving indirect evidence of an intermediate that reacts either to form the adduct or to decay back to the ground state. Since there is no measurable delay between the decay of the triplet and the formation of the adduct, we conclude that this intermediate reacts much faster than it is formed. The LOV1-C57S mutant shows a weak and slowly decaying (τ {$>$} 100 μs) transient whose decay associated spectrum has bands at 375 and 500 nm, with a shoulder at 400 nm. This transient is insensitive to the pH change in the range 6.5–10.0 but increases on addition of β-mercaptoethanol as the reducing agent. We assign this intermediate to the radical anion which is protected from protonation by the protein. We propose that the adduct is formed via the same intermediate by combination of the radical ion pair.},

  abstract = {The animal-like cryptochrome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CraCRY) is a recently discovered photoreceptor that controls the transcriptional profile and sexual life cycle of this alga by both blue and red light. CraCRY has the uncommon feature of efficient formation and longevity of the semireduced neutral form of its FAD cofactor upon blue light illumination. Tyrosine Y373 plays a crucial role by elongating , as fourth member, the electron transfer (ET) chain found in most other cryptochromes and DNA photolyases, which comprises a conserved tryptophan triad. Here, we report the full mechanism of light-induced FADH• formation in CraCRY using transient absorption spectroscopy from hundreds of femtoseconds to seconds. Electron transfer starts from ultrafast reduction of excited FAD to FAD•– by the proximal tryptophan (0.4 ps) and is followed by delocalized migration of the produced WH•+ radical along the tryptophan triad (∼4 and ∼50 ps). Oxidation of Y373 by coupled ET to WH•+ and deprotonation then proceeds in ∼800 ps, without any significant kinetic isotope effect, nor a pH effect between pH 6.5 and 9.0. The FAD•–/Y373• pair is formed with high quantum yield (∼60\%); its intrinsic decay by recombination is slow (∼50 ms), favoring reduction of Y373• by extrinsic agents and protonation of FAD•– to form the long-lived, red-light absorbing FADH• species. Possible mechanisms of tyrosine oxidation by ultrafast proton-coupled ET in CraCRY, a process about 40 times faster than the archetypal tyrosine-Z oxidation in photosystem II, are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The chapter begins with an explanation of the diffraction problem in optics and electromagnetic theory, with examples. The theory of diffraction involves an approximation scheme that may be considered an improvement over the ray approximation while being distinct from scattering theory. The determination of the diffracted field requires us to take into consideration a set of relevant boundary conditions and the vector nature of the electromagnetic field. For a large class of diffraction problems, however, a scalar approach is effective, while the boundary conditions are also not of crucial relevance. The Kirchhoff scalar theory serves as an important starting point, though it suffers from a number of theoretical limitations, notably those relating to the screen boundary conditions and to the assumption that the aperture field can be replaced with the incident field. The use of Dirichlet- and Neumann-type Green’s functions in Rayleigh-Sommerfeld scalar theory circumvents the first of these but the theory continues to suffer from the second. The use of diffracted ray paths in scalar theory is explained, where the field in the diffraction region appears essentially as a summation of phase-dependent terms over possible diffracted ray paths. The Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction formulas are explained. The Fresnel-Kirchhoff principle of wave propagation is stated, and the Fresnel approximation for wave propagation from a planar surface is obtained with the approximation of a quadratic expression for the phase. Fresnel diffraction formulas for a rectangular aperture and for a straight edge are worked out in terms of Fresnel integrals. An important characteristic of Fraunhofer diffraction is that the phase is linear in the aperture coordinates, and the diffracted field appears as the Fourier transform of the aperture function. The diffracted field is worked out in several commonly encountered instances of Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction problem is viewed in the broader context of wave propagation from one plane to another, where the angular spectrum of the wave field assumes relevance, providing an alternative approach to scalar diffraction theory. Vector formulations of the Kirchhoff approach adopted by Stratton and Chu and by Franz are briefly outlined. The use of dyadic Green’s functions in the development of exact integral formulas for the diffracted electromagnetic field is explained. The exact solution for the straight-edge diffraction problem is outlined. The Smythe formula, which is an exact integral expression for the diffracted field, is stated. The statement of Babnet’s principle for complementary screens is presented. The solutions to the problems of diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a narrow slit and that by a small circular aperture are stated and explained in the leading order of the long wavelength approximation. The geometrical theory of diffraction, pioneered by Keller, is briefly outlined. The effect of aberrations on imaging in the presence of diffraction is discussed. Diffraction with partially coherent radiation is considered in outline. Finally, an introduction to scattering in electromagnetic theory and optics is presented, where features of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering are described and compared. A brief introduction to Raman scattering is included.},

Among these FPs are the brightest green fluorescent protein (GFP) homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, Aequorea species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including 2 that are photoconvertible. X-ray crystallography revealed that Aequorea CPs contain a chemically novel chromophore with an unexpected crosslink to the main polypeptide chain. Because of the unique attributes of several of these newly discovered FPs, we expect that Aequorea will, once again, give rise to an entirely new generation of useful probes for bioimaging and biosensing.},

Here we describe a new rhodopsin clade from cold-adapted organisms and cold environments, such as glaciers, denoted as CryoRhodopsins (CryoRs). Our data suggest that CryoRs have photosensory activity. A distinguishing feature of the clade is the presence of a buried arginine residue close to the cytoplasmic face of its members. Combining single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography with the rhodopsin activation by light, we demonstrate that the arginine stabilizes a strongly blue-shifted intermediate of an extremely slow CryoRhodopsin photocycle. Together with extensive spectroscopic characterization, our investigations on CryoR1 and CryoR2 proteins reveal mechanisms of photoswitching in the newly identified clade and demonstrate principles of the adaptation of these rhodopsins to low temperatures.},

The critical step in accomplishing this by x-ray crystallography is the routine availability of well-ordered three-dimensional crystals. We have devised a novel, rational approach to meet this goal using quasisolid lipidic cubic phases. This membrane system, consisting of lipid, water, and protein in appropriate proportions, forms a structured, transparent, and complex three-dimensional lipidic array, which is pervaded by an intercommunicating aqueous channel system. Such matrices provide nucleation sites (“seeding”) and support growth by lateral diffusion of protein molecules in the membrane (“feeding”). Bacteriorhodopsin crystals were obtained from bicontinuous cubic phases, but not from micellar systems, implying a critical role of the continuity of the diffusion space (the bilayer) on crystal growth. Hexagonal bacteriorhodopsin crystals diffracted to 3.7 Å resolution, with a space group P63, and unit cell dimensions of a = b = 62 Å, c = 108 Å; α = β = 90° and γ = 120°.},

We present a high-resolution room temperature structure of the class Ie R2 protein radical captured by x-ray free electron laser serial femtosecond crystallography. The structure reveals conformational reorganization to shield the radical and connect it to the translocation path, with structural changes propagating to the surface where the protein interacts with the catalytic R1 subunit. Restructuring of the hydrogen bond network, including a notably short O–O interaction of 2.41 angstroms, likely tunes and gates the radical during PCET. These structural results help explain radical handling and mobilization in RNR and have general implications for radical transfer in proteins.},

  abstract = {We used UV resonance Raman spectroscopy to characterize the equilibrium conformation and the kinetics of thermal denaturation of a 21 amino acid, mainly alanine, α-helical peptide (AP). The 204-nm UV resonance Raman spectra show selective enhancements of the amide vibrations, whose intensities and frequencies strongly depend on the peptide secondary structure. These AP Raman spectra were accurately modeled by a linear combination of the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of the pure random coil and the pure α-helix conformations; this demonstrates that the AP helix-coil equilibrium is well-described by a two-state model. We constructed a new transient UV resonance Raman spectrometer and developed the necessary methodologies to measure the nanosecond relaxation of AP following a 3-ns T-jump. We obtained the T-jump by using a 1.9-μm IR pulse that heats the solvent water. We probed the AP relaxation using delayed 204-nm excitation pulses which excite the Raman spectra of the amide backbone vibrations. We observe little AP structural changes within the first 40 ns, after which the α-helix starts unfolding. We determined the temperature dependence of the folding and unfolding rates and found that the unfolding rate constants show Arrhenius-type behavior with an apparent ∼8 kcal/mol activation barrier and a reciprocal rate constant of 240 ± 60 ns at 37 °C. However, the folding rate constants show a negative activation barrier, indicating a failure of transition-state theory in the simple two-state modeling of AP thermal unfolding, which assumes a temperature-independent potential energy profile along the reaction coordinate. Our measurements of the initial steps in the α-helical structure evolution support recent protein folding landscape and funnel theories; our temperature-dependent rate constants sense the energy landscape complexity at the earliest stages of folding and unfolding.},

In SFX, a variety of sample delivery methods with unique advantages have been developed and applied. The combination of existing sample delivery methods can enable a new approach to SFX data collection that combines the advantages of the individual methods. This study introduces a combined inject-and-transfer system (BITS) method for sample delivery in SFX experiments: a hybrid injection and fixed-target scanning method. BITS allows for solution samples to be reliably deposited on ultraviolet ozone (UVO)-treated polyimide films, at a minimum flow rate of 0.5 nl min-1, in both vertical and horizontal scanning modes. To utilize BITS in SFX experiments, lysozyme crystal samples were embedded in a viscous lard medium and injected at flow rates of 50–100 nl min-1 through a syringe needle onto a UVO-treated polyimide film, which was mounted on a fixed-target scan stage. The crystal samples deposited on the film were raster scanned with an X-ray free electron laser using a motion stage in both horizontal and vertical directions. Using the BITS method, the room-temperature structure of lysozyme was successfully determined at a resolution of 2.1 Å, and thus BITS could be utilized in future SFX experiments.},

  abstract = {Fixed-target serial femtosecond crystallography (FT-SFX) was an important advance in crystallography by dramatically reducing sample consumption, while maintaining the benefits of SFX for obtaining crystal structures at room temperature without radiation damage. Despite a number of advantages, preparation of a sample holder for the sample delivery in FT-SFX with the use of many crystals in a single mount at ambient temperature is challenging as it can be complicated and costly, and thus, development of an efficient sample holder is essential. In this study, we introduced a nylon mesh-based sample holder enclosed by a polyimide film. This sample holder can be rapidly manufactured using a commercially available nylon mesh with pores of a desired size at a low cost without challenging technology. Furthermore, this simple device is highly efficient in data acquisition. We performed FT-SFX using a nylon mesh-based sample holder and collected over 130,000 images on a single sample holder using a 30~Hz X-ray pulse for 1.2\,h. We determined the crystal structures of lysozyme and glucose isomerase using the nylon mesh at 1.65 and 1.75\,Å, respectively. The nylon mesh exposed to X-rays produced very low levels of background scattering at 3.75 and 4.30\,Å, which are negligible for data analysis. Our method provides a simple and rapid but highly efficient way to deliver samples for FT-SFX.},

Fixed-target SFX (FT-SFX) can minimize sample consumption and physical effects on crystals during sample delivery. In FT-SFX studies, having a sample holder that can stably fix crystal samples is one of the key elements required for efficient data collection. Hence, development of sample holders from new materials capable of supporting various crystal sizes and shapes may expand the applications of FT-SFX. Here, a viscous-media-based crystal support in a sample holder for FT-SFX is introduced. Crystal samples were embedded in viscous media, namely gelatin and agarose, which were enclosed in a polyimide film. In the vertically placed sample holder, 10–15\%(w/v) viscous gelatin and 1–4\%(w/v) agarose gel stably supported crystals between two polyimide films, thereby preventing the crystals from descending owing to gravity. Using this method, FT-SFX experiments were performed with glucose isomerase and lysozyme embedded in gelatin and agarose, respectively. The room-temperature crystal structures of glucose isomerase and lysozyme were successfully determined at 1.75 and 1.80 Å resolutions, respectively. The glucose isomerase and lysozyme diffraction analyses were not impeded by excessive background scattering from the viscous media. This method is useful for delivering crystal samples of various sizes and shapes in FT-SFX experiments.},

  abstract = {In green fluorescent protein, photo-excitation leads to excited-state proton transfer from its chromophore, leaving behind a strongly fluorescing anion, while the proton is commonly thought to migrate internally to Glu-222. X-ray data show that the protein contains more extended hydrogen-bonded networks that can support proton migration (i.e., proton wires). Here we study the temperature-dependence of the transient fluorescence from both the acid and anionic forms up to 15ns. At low temperatures, we find that the (lifetime-corrected) fluorescence of the acidic form decays asymptotically as t-1/2, following quantitatively the solution of a one-dimensional diffusion equation for reversible geminate recombination with quenching. This indicates proton migration along the internal proton wires. A small degree of geminate proton quenching is attributed to the formation of the zwitterion by proton migration on a side-branch of the proton wire. Above 230K, the fluorescence kinetics undergo a transition, exhibiting an asymptotic t-3/2 decay, and the quenching effect disappears. We interpret these findings as evidence for a conformational change enabling the rotation of Thr-203, which eventually allows the proton to escape to the exterior solution.},

  abstract = {Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and its variant Cerulean are genetically encoded fluorophores widely used as donors in FRET-based cell imaging experiments. First, we have confirmed through denaturation experiments that the double-peak spectroscopic signature of these fluorescent proteins originates from the indole ring of the chromophore. Then, to explain the improvement in the fluorescence properties of Cerulean compared to those of ECFP, we have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of these two proteins at physiological pH and performed molecular dynamics simulations. In both proteins, the N-terminal half of the seventh strand exhibits two conformations. These conformations both have a complex set of van der Waals interactions with the chromophore and, as our simulations suggest, they interconvert on a nanosecond time scale. The Y145A and H148D mutations in Cerulean stabilize these interactions and allow the chromophore to be more planar, better packed, and less prone to collisional quenching, albeit only intermittently. As a consequence, the probability of nonradiative decay is significantly decreased. Our results highlight the considerable dynamical flexibility that exists in the vicinity of the tryptophan-based chromophore of these engineered fluorescent proteins and provide insights that should allow the design of mutants with enhanced optical properties.},

However, this template-directed phosphoryl transfer activity remains orders of magnitude slower than native phosphodiester synthesis. Here, we used time-resolved x-ray crystallography to show that NP-DNA synthesis proceeds with a single detectable calcium ion in the active site. Using insights from isotopic and elemental effects, we propose that one-metal-ion electrophilic substrate activation is inferior to the native two-metal-ion mechanism. We found that this deficiency in divalent activation could be ameliorated by trivalent rare earth and post–transition metal cations, substantially enhancing NP-DNA synthesis. Scandium(III), in particular, confers highly specific NP activity with kinetics enhanced by more than 100-fold over calcium(II), yielding NP-DNA strands up to 100 nucleotides in length.},

Pump–probe time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) has been used to capture structural dynamics of light-sensitive proteins. In this approach, it is crucial to avoid light contamination in the samples when analyzing a particular reaction intermediate. Here, a method for determining a condition that avoids light contamination of the PSII microcrystals while minimizing sample consumption in TR-SFX is described. By swapping the pump and probe pulses with a very short delay between them, the structural changes that occur during the S1-to-S2 transition were examined and a boundary of the excitation region was accurately determined. With the sample flow rate and concomitant illumination conditions determined, the S2-state structure of PSII could be analyzed at room temperature, revealing the structural changes that occur during the S1-to-S2 transition at ambient temperature. Though the structure of the manganese cluster was similar to previous studies, the behaviors of the water molecules in the two channels (O1 and O4 channels) were found to be different. By comparing with the previous studies performed at low temperature or with a different delay time, the possible channels for water inlet and structural changes important for the water-splitting reaction were revealed.},

  abstract = {The crystallographic maps that are routinely used during the structure-solution workflow are almost always model-biased because model information is used for their calculation. As these maps are also used to validate the atomic models that result from model building and refinement, this constitutes an immediate problem: anything added to the model will manifest itself in the map and thus hinder the validation. OMIT maps are a common tool to verify the presence of atoms in the model. The simplest way to compute an OMIT map is to exclude the atoms in question from the structure, update the corresponding structure factors and compute a residual map. It is then expected that if these atoms are present in the crystal structure, the electron density for the omitted atoms will be seen as positive features in this map. This, however, is complicated by the flat bulk-solvent model which is almost universally used in modern crystallographic refinement programs. This model postulates constant electron density at any voxel of the unit-cell volume that is not occupied by the atomic model. Consequently, if the density arising from the omitted atoms is weak then the bulk-solvent model may obscure it further. A possible solution to this problem is to prevent bulk solvent from entering the selected OMIT regions, which may improve the interpretative power of residual maps. This approach is called a polder (OMIT) map. Polder OMIT maps can be particularly useful for displaying weak densities of ligands, solvent molecules, side chains, alternative conformations and residues both in terminal regions and in loops. The tools described in this manuscript have been implemented and are available in PHENIX.},

  abstract = {The quantum yield of photoisomerisation of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) strongly depends on peak power and wavelength with femtosecond optical excitation. Using systematic power titrations and addition of second order dispersion resulting in 140, 300 and 600 fs pulse durations, the one and multi-photon cross-sections at 400, 450 and 490 nm have been assessed from transient absorption spectroscopy and additionally the Z-scan technique. Applying a target model that incorporates photoselection theory, estimates for the cross-sections for stimulated emission and absorption of the first excited state, the amount of ultrafast internal conversion and the underlying species associated dynamics have been determined. The final quantum yields for photoisomerisation were found to be 0.06, 0.14–0.19 and 0.02 for excitation wavelengths 400, 450 and 490 nm and found to increase with increasing pulse durations. Transient absorption measurements and Z-scan measurements at 450 nm, coinciding with the maximum wavelength of the ground state absorption, indicate that the photochemical quantum yield is intrinsically limited by an ultrafast internal conversion reaction as well as by stimulated emission cross-section. With excitation at 400 nm photoisomerisation quantum yield is further significantly limited by competing multi-photon excitation into excited state absorption at 385 nm previously proposed to result in photoionisation. With excitation at 490 nm the photoisomerisation quantum yield is predominantly limited further by the significantly higher stimulated emission cross-section compared to ground state cross-section as well as multi-photon processes. In addition to photoionisation, a second product of multi-photon excitation is identified and characterised by an induced absorption at 500 nm and a time constant of 2 ps for relaxation. With power densities up to 138 GW cm-2 the measurements have not provided indication for coherent multi-photon absorption of PYP. In the saturation regime with 450 nm excitation, the limit for the photoisomerisation quantum yield was found to be 0.14–0.19 and the excited state absorption cross-section 6.1 × 10-17 cm2 or 0.36 times the ground state cross-section of 1.68 × 10-16 cm2 per molecule. This places a fundamental restriction on the maximum populations and sample penetration that may be achieved for instance in femtosecond pump–probe experiments with molecular crystals of PYP.},

Structural changes of the metal cluster and its environment during the S-state transitions have been studied on the microsecond timescale. Here we use pump-probe serial femtosecond crystallography to reveal the structural dynamics of PSII from nanoseconds to milliseconds after illumination with one~flash (1F) or two flashes (2F). YZ, a tyrosine residue that connects the reaction centre P680 and the Mn4CaO5 cluster, showed structural changes on a nanosecond timescale, as did its surrounding amino acid residues and water molecules, reflecting the fast transfer of electrons and protons after flash illumination. Notably, one water molecule emerged in the vicinity of Glu189 of the D1 subunit of PSII (D1-E189), and was bound to the Ca2+ ion on a sub-microsecond timescale after 2F illumination. This water molecule disappeared later with the concomitant increase of O6, suggesting that it is the origin of O6. We also observed concerted movements of water molecules in the O1, O4 and Cl-1 channels and their surrounding amino acid residues to complete the sequence of electron transfer, proton release and substrate water delivery. These results provide crucial insights into the structural dynamics of PSII during S-state transitions as well as O–O bond formation.},

  abstract = {Phototropism, or the differential cell elongation exhibited by a plant organ in response to directional blue light, provides the plant with a means to optimize photosynthetic light capture in the aerial portion and water and nutrient acquisition in the roots. Tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular, biochemical, and cellular bases of phototropism in recent years. Six photoreceptors and their associated signaling pathways have been linked to phototropic responses under various conditions. Primary detection of directional light occurs at the plasma membrane, whereas secondary modulatory photoreception occurs in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Intracellular responses to light cues are processed to regulate cell-to-cell movement of auxin to allow establishment of a trans-organ gradient of the hormone. Photosignaling also impinges on the transcriptional regulation response established as a result of changes in local auxin concentrations. Three additional phytohormone signaling pathways have also been shown to influence phototropic responsiveness, and these pathways are influenced by the photoreceptor signaling as well. Here, we will discuss this complex dance of intra- and intercellular responses that are regulated by these many systems to give rise to a rapid and robust adaptation response observed as organ bending.},

  abstract = {The lipid cubic phase (LCP) has been used extensively as a medium for crystallizing membrane proteins. It is an attractive environment in which to perform such studies because it incorporates a lipid bilayer. It is therefore considered a useful and a faithful biomembrane mimetic. Here, we bring together evidence that supports this view. Biophysical characterizations are described demonstrating that the cubic phase is a porous medium into and out of which water-soluble molecules can diffuse for binding to and reaction with reconstituted proteins. The proteins themselves are shown to be functionally reconstituted into and to have full mobility in the bilayered membrane, a prerequisite for LCP crystallogenesis. Spectroscopic methods have been used to characterize the conformation and disposition of proteins in the mesophase. Procedures for performing activity assays on enzymes directly in the cubic phase have been reported. Specific examples described here include a kinase and two transferases, where quantitative kinetics and mechanism-defining measurements were performed directly or via a coupled assay system. Finally, ligand-binding assays are described, where binding to proteins in the mesophase membrane was monitored directly by eye and indirectly by fluorescence quenching, enabling binding constant determinations for targets with affinity values in the micromolar and nanomolar range. These results make a convincing case that the lipid bilayer of the cubic mesophase is an excellent membrane mimetic and a suitable medium in which to perform not only crystallogenesis but also biochemical and biophysical characterizations of membrane proteins.},

A case is made that the Hula-Twist mechanism, postulated in 1985 as a photochemical reaction pathway for a polyene chromophore imbedded in a protein binding cavity such as those of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin, is also a dominant reaction pathway for a diene, or a longer polyene confined in a rigid (relative to isomerization rate) medium. The conventional one-bond-flip process is the preferred reaction pathway in a fluid medium. While defining experiments are proposed, this dual mechanistic approach successfully accounts for all examples in the literature on photoisomerization reactions whether involving conformational changes or not.},

Such redox changes can be efficiently achieved by photoinduced electron transfer (ET) through a series of aromatic residues in the enzyme. Here, we report our complete characterization of photoreduction dynamics of photolyase with femtosecond resolution. With various site-directed mutations, we identified all possible electron donors in the enzyme and determined their ET timescales. The excited cofactor behaves as an electron sink to draw electron flow from a series of encircling aromatic molecules in three distinct layers from the active site in the center to the protein surface. The dominant electron flow follows the conserved tryptophan triad in a hopping pathway across the layers with multiple tunneling steps. These ET dynamics occur ultrafast in less than 150 ps and are strongly coupled with local protein and solvent relaxations. The reverse electron flow from the flavin is slow and in the nanosecond range to ensure high reduction efficiency. With 12 experimentally determined elementary ET steps and 6 ET reaction pairs, the enzyme exhibits a distinct reduction–potential gradient along the same aromatic residues with favorable reorganization energies to drive a highly unidirectional electron flow toward the active-site center from the protein surface.},

In this perspective, we review the recent progress in the repair dynamics and mechanisms of both types of DNA restoration by photolyases. We first report the spectroscopic characterization of flavin in various redox states and the active-site solvation dynamics in photolyases. We then systematically summarize the detailed repair dynamics of damaged DNA by photolyases and a biomimetic system through resolving all elementary steps on ultrafast timescales, including multiple intermolecular electron- and proton-transfer reactions and bond-breaking and -making processes. We determined the unique electron tunneling pathways, identified the key functional residues and revealed the molecular origin of high repair efficiency, and thus elucidate the molecular mechanisms and repair photocycles at the most fundamental level. We finally conclude that the active sites of photolyases, unlike the aqueous solution for the biomimetic system, provide a unique electrostatic environment and local flexibility and thus a dedicated synergy for all elementary dynamics to maximize the repair efficiency. This repair photomachine is the first enzyme that the entire functional evolution is completely mapped out in real time.},

  abstract = {Controlling the reactivity of high-valent Fe(IV)–O catalytic intermediates, Compounds I and II, generated in heme enzymes upon reaction with dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide, is important for function. It has been hypothesized that the presence (wet) or absence (dry) of distal heme pocket water molecules can influence whether Compound I undergoes sequential one-electron additions or a concerted two-electron reduction. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the role of water in the heme distal pocket of a dye-decolorizing peroxidase utilizing a combination of serial femtosecond crystallography and rapid kinetic studies. In a dry distal heme site, Compound I reduction proceeds through a mechanism in which Compound II concentration is low. This reaction shows a strong deuterium isotope effect, indicating that reduction is coupled to proton uptake. The resulting protonated Compound II (Fe(IV)–OH) rapidly reduces to the ferric state, giving the appearance of a two-electron transfer process. In a wet site, reduction of Compound I is faster, has no deuterium effect, and yields highly populated Compound II, which is subsequently reduced to the ferric form. This work provides a definitive experimental test of the hypothesis advanced in the literature that relates sequential or concerted electron transfer to Compound I in wet or dry distal heme sites.},

  abstract = {Obtaining structures of intact redox states of metal centers derived from zero dose X-ray crystallography can advance our mechanistic understanding of metalloenzymes. In dye-decolorising heme peroxidases (DyPs), controversy exists regarding the mechanistic role of the distal heme residues aspartate and arginine in the heterolysis of peroxide to form the catalytic intermediate compound I (FeIV=O and a porphyrin cation radical). Using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX), we have determined the pristine structures of the FeIII and FeIV=O redox states of a B-type DyP. These structures reveal a water-free distal heme site that, together with the presence of an asparagine, imply the use of the distal arginine as a catalytic base. A combination of mutagenesis and kinetic studies corroborate such a role. Our SFX approach thus provides unique insight into how the distal heme site of DyPs can be tuned to select aspartate or arginine for the rate enhancement of peroxide heterolysis.},

  abstract = {Photoisomerization of the retinal of bacteriorhodopsin initiates a cyclic reaction in which a proton is translocated across the membrane. Studies of this protein promise a better understanding of how ion pumps function. Together with a large amount of spectroscopic and mutational data, the atomic structure of bacteriorhodopsin, determined in the last decade at increasing resolutions, has suggested plausible but often contradictory mechanisms. X-ray diffraction of bacteriorhodopsin crystals grown in cubic lipid phase revealed unexpected two-fold symmetries that indicate merohedral twinning along the crystallographicc axis. The structure, refined to 2.3 angstroms taking this twinning into account, is different from earlier models, including that most recently reported. One of the carboxyl oxygen atoms of the proton acceptor Asp85 is connected to the proton donor, the retinal Schiff base, through a hydrogen-bonded water and forms a second hydrogen bond with another water. The other carboxyl oxygen atom of Asp85 accepts a hydrogen bond from Thr89. This structure forms the active site. The nearby Arg82 is the center of a network of numerous hydrogen-bonded residues and an ordered water molecule. This network defines the pathway of the proton from the buried Schiff base to the extracellular surface.},

  abstract = {Whether long-range quantum coherent states could exist in biological systems, and beyond low-temperature regimes where quantum physics is known to be applicable, has been the subject to debate for decades. It was proposed by Fröhlich that vibrational modes within protein molecules can order and condense into a lowest-frequency vibrational mode in a process similar to Bose-Einstein condensation, and thus that macroscopic coherence could potentially be observed in biological systems. Despite the prediction of these so-called Fröhlich condensates almost five decades ago, experimental evidence thereof has been lacking. Here, we present the first experimental observation of Fröhlich condensation in a protein structure. To that end, and to overcome the challenges associated with probing low-frequency molecular vibrations in proteins (which has hampered understanding of their role in proteins' function), we combined terahertz techniques with a highly sensitive X-ray crystallographic method to visualize low-frequency vibrational modes in the protein structure of hen-egg white lysozyme. We found that 0.4 THz electromagnetic radiation induces non-thermal changes in electron density. In particular, we observed a local increase of electron density in a long α-helix motif consistent with a subtle longitudinal compression of the helix. These observed electron density changes occur at a low absorption rate indicating that thermalization of terahertz photons happens on a micro- to milli-second time scale, which is much slower than the expected nanosecond time scale due to damping of delocalized low frequency vibrations. Our analyses show that the micro- to milli-second lifetime of the vibration can only be explained by Fröhlich condensation, a phenomenon predicted almost half a century ago, yet never experimentally confirmed.},

  abstract = {The oligotrophic ubiquitous SAR11 clade of alphaproteobacteria and Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria numerically dominate bacterioplankton that drives the ecosystems of the five subtropical oceanic gyres, which cumulatively cover 40\% of earth. Common gyre features like extremely low nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations as well as dominance of obligate oligotrophs suggest that the gyre ecosystems are uniform and function at the same pace. Competition in oligotrophic environment should favour optimisation of surface to volume ratio and selection for efficient high affinity transporters, which could be structurally divergent from known transport systems.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}To test the hypothesis of gyre ecosystem similarity, SAR11 abundance and metabolic rates (used as a proxy for growth) were compared between three oceanic gyres by assessing their in situ uptake rates of amino acids: leucine and methionine (chapter 3). Bacterial abundance as well as absolute SAR11 amino acid uptake rates were higher in more productive waters of the Equatorial convergence zone of the Atlantic Ocean and SAR11 abundance in the surface mixed layer were similar in the three studied gyres, supporting the similarity hypothesis. However, SAR11 cells took up amino acids 3 – 4 times slower in the South Pacific gyre than in the North and South Atlantic gyres, despite similar concentrations of the amino acids in the gyres. Evidently SAR11 concentration similarity conceals metabolic differences, which should better reflect contrasts in the gyre environments of the two oceans. Thus, the SAR11 metabolic rates indicate that the microbe-driven gyre ecosystem of the South Pacific could function one third slower than the analogous ecosystems of the Atlantic.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}Being able to dominate bacterioplankton while competing for nutrients at nanomolar concentrations, oligotrophs might possess uniquely efficient uptake systems. Identification of porins and high affinity ABC transporters in available genomes was guided by bioinformatical analysis (chapter 4), showing great diversity. Identified porins as well as phosphate-(PstS) and iron-binding proteins (FutA) of Prochlorococcus, which are responsible for the respective transporters affinity, were chosen for analysis using X-ray crystallography (chapter 5, 6 and 7). In silico analysis of porin models revealed unique features, which might influence transport function in vivo. High resolution structures of PstS and FutA were determined, enabling a thorough comparison to other substrate-binding proteins such as FutA from Trichodesmium. Interestingly, there is little variation in overall ligand coordination. However, small structural differences might hint at differences in ligand binding. Analysis of the binding site of FutA shows unexpected iron-binding plasticity in the determined crystal structures, which might have implications for iron acquisition in vivo. Employing a combination of UV-Vis spectroscopy and multi-crystal merging techniques made it possible to monitor X-ray induced site specific radiation damage on the iron centre of FutA (chapter 8). The dose of the multi-crystal FutA structure is possibly the lowest reported X-ray dose, to our knowledge, for a crystal structure determined using non-XFEL methods, enabling us to study the iron-binding site mostly unaffected by radiation damage and X-ray induced artefacts.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}In conclusion, this work was aimed to unveil unique adaptations of the most abundant organisms on earth. The employed multi-disciplinary approach led to discoveries with implications for diverse ecological and structural investigations.},

  abstract = {Flavin coenzymes are universally found in biological redox reactions. DNA photolyases, with their flavin chromophore (FAD), utilize blue light for DNA repair and photoreduction. The latter process involves two single-electron transfers to FAD with an intermittent protonation step to prime the enzyme active for DNA repair. Here we use time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography to describe how light-driven electron transfers trigger subsequent nanosecond-to-microsecond entanglement between FAD and its Asn/Arg-Asp redox sensor triad. We found that this key feature within the photolyase-cryptochrome family regulates FAD re-hybridization and protonation. After first electron transfer, the FAD•- isoalloxazine ring twists strongly when the arginine closes in to stabilize the negative charge. Subsequent breakage of the arginine–aspartate salt bridge allows proton transfer from arginine to FAD•-. Our molecular videos demonstrate how the protein environment of redox cofactors organizes multiple electron/proton transfer events in an ordered fashion, which could be applicable to other redox systems such as photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyases harness the energy of blue light to repair UV-induced DNA CPDs. Upon binding, CPD photolyases cause the photodamage to flip out of the duplex DNA and into the catalytic site of the enzyme. This process, called base-flipping, induces a kink in the DNA, as well as an unpaired bubble, which are stabilized by a network of protein–nucleic acid interactions. Previously, several co-crystal structures have been reported in which the binding mode of CPD photolyases has been studied in detail. However, in all cases the internucleoside linkage of the photodamage site was a chemically synthesized formacetal analogue and not the natural phosphodiester. Here, the first crystal structure and conformational analysis via molecular-dynamics simulations of a class II CPD photolyase in complex with photodamaged DNA that contains a natural cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer with an intra-lesion phosphodiester linkage are presented. It is concluded that a highly conserved bubble-intruding region (BIR) mediates stabilization of the open form of CPD DNA when complexed with class II CPD photolyases.},

We obtained 18 snapshots that show time-dependent changes in four reaction loci. We used these results to create a movie that depicts the repair of CPD lesions in the picosecond-to-nanosecond range, followed by the recovery of the enzymatic moieties involved in catalysis, completing the formation of the fully reduced enzyme-product complex at 500 nanoseconds. Finally, back-flip intermediates of the thymine bases to reanneal the DNA were captured at 25 to 200 microseconds.

These structural studies of reaction dynamics drive the need for on-line in crystallo spectroscopy methods to complement the crystallography experiment. The recent applications of combined spectroscopy and crystallography methods enable on-line determination of in crystallo reaction kinetics and structures of catalytic intermediates, sample integrity, and radiation-induced sample modifications, if any, as well as heterogeneity of crystals from different preparations or sample batches. This review describes different modes of spectroscopy that are combined with the crystallography experiment at both synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser facilities, and the complementary information that each method can provide to facilitate the structural study of enzyme catalysis and protein dynamics.},

Our work builds on possibilities unleashed by mix-and-inject serial crystallography (MISC) at X-ray free electron laser facilities. In this approach, enzymatic reactions are triggered by mixing substrate or ligand solutions with enzyme microcrystals. Here, we report in atomic detail (between 2.2 and 2.7\,Å resolution) by room-temperature, time-resolved crystallography with millisecond time-resolution (with timepoints between 3\,ms and 700\,ms) how the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme BlaC is inhibited by sulbactam (SUB). Our results reveal ligand binding heterogeneity, ligand gating, cooperativity, induced fit, and conformational selection all from the same set of MISC data, detailing how SUB approaches the catalytic clefts and binds to the enzyme noncovalently before reacting to a trans-enamine. This was made possible in part by the application of singular value decomposition to the MISC data using a program that remains functional even if unit cell parameters change up to 3\,Å during the reaction.},

  abstract = {The crystal structure of the cyan-fluorescent Cerulean green fluorescent protein (GFP), a variant of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), has been determined to 2.0 Å. Cerulean bears an internal fluorophore composed of an indole moiety derived from Y66W, conjugated to the GFP-like imidazolinone ring via a methylene bridge. Cerulean undergoes highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to yellow acceptor molecules and exhibits significantly reduced excited-state heterogeneity. This feature was rationally engineered in ECFP by substituting His148 with an aspartic acid [Rizzo et al. (2004) Nat. Biotechnol. 22, 445], rendering Cerulean useful for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The X-ray structure is consistent with a single conformation of the chromophore and surrounding residues and may therefore provide a structural rationale for the previously described monoexponential fluorescence decay. Unexpectedly, the carboxyl group of H148D is found in a buried position, directly contacting the indole nitrogen of the chromophore via a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Compared to the similarly constructed ECFP chromophore, the indole group of Cerulean is rotated around the methylene bridge to adopt a cis-coplanar conformation with respect to the imidazolinone ring, resulting in a close edge-to-edge contact of the two ring systems. The double-humped absorbance spectrum persists in single-crystal absorbance measurements, casting doubt on the idea that ground state conformational heterogeneity forms the basis of the two overlapping transitions. At low pH, a blue shift in absorbance of 10-15 nm suggests a pH-induced structural transition that proceeds with a time constant of 47 (±2) min and is reversible. Possible interpretations in terms of chromophore isomerization are presented.},

  abstract = {Crystallographic resolution is a key characteristic of diffraction data and represents one of the first decisions an experimenter has to make in data evaluation. Conservative approaches to the high-resolution cutoff determination are based on a number of criteria applied to the processed X-ray diffraction data only. However, high-resolution data that are weaker than arbitrary cutoffs can still result in the improvement of electron-density maps and refined structure models. Therefore, the impact of reflections from resolution shells higher than those previously used in conservative structure refinement should be analysed by the paired refinement protocol. For this purpose, a tool called PAIREF was developed to provide automation of this protocol. As a new feature, a complete cross-validation procedure has also been implemented. Here, the design, usage and control of the program are described, and its application is demonstrated on six data sets. The results prove that the inclusion of high-resolution data beyond the conventional criteria can lead to more accurate structure models.},

  abstract = {Major scientific challenges that are beyond the capability of individuals need to be addressed by multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional consortia. Examples of these endeavours include the Human Genome Project, and more recently, the Structural Genomics (SG) initiative.{$\quad$}The SG initiative pursues the expansion of structural coverage to include at least one structural representative for each protein family to derive the remaining structures using homology modelling. However, biological function is inherently connected with protein dynamics that can be studied by knowing different structures of the same protein. This ensemble of structures provides snapshots of protein conformational diversity under native conditions. Thus, sequence redundancy in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (i.e. crystallization of the same protein under different conditions) is therefore an essential input contributing to experimentally based studies of protein dynamics and providing insights into protein function.{$\quad$}In this work, we show that sequence redundancy, a key concept for exploring protein dynamics, is highly biased and fundamentally incomplete in the PDB. Additionally, our results show that dynamical behaviour of proteins cannot be inferred using homologous proteins. Minor to moderate changes in sequence can produce great differences in dynamical behaviour.{$\quad$}Nonetheless, the structural and dynamical incompleteness of the PDB is apparently unrelated concepts in SG. While the first could be reversed by promoting the extension of the structural coverage, we would like to emphasize that further focused efforts will be needed to amend the incompleteness of the PDB in terms of dynamical information content, essential to fully understand protein function.},

  abstract = {Aromatic residues cluster in the core of folded proteins, where~they stabilize the structure through multiple interactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in the 1970s showed that aromatic side chains can undergo ring flips—that is, 180° rotations—despite their role in maintaining the protein fold1–3. It was suggested that large-scale ‘breathing’ motions of the surrounding protein environment would be necessary to accommodate these ring flipping events1. However, the structural details of these motions have remained unclear. Here we uncover the structural rearrangements that accompany ring flipping of a buried tyrosine residue in an SH3 domain. Using NMR, we show that the tyrosine side chain flips to a low-populated, minor state and, through a proteome-wide sequence analysis, we design mutants that stabilize this state, which allows us to capture its high-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. A void volume is generated around the tyrosine ring during the structural transition between the major and minor state, and this allows fast flipping to take place. Our results provide structural insights into the protein breathing motions that are associated with ring flipping. More generally, our study has implications for protein design and structure prediction by showing how the local protein environment influences amino acid side chain conformations and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Cyan fluorescent proteins (CFPs), such as Cerulean, are widely used as donor fluorophores in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. Nonetheless, the most widely used variants suffer from drawbacks that include low quantum yields and unstable flurorescence. To improve the fluorescence properties of Cerulean, we used the X-ray structure to rationally target specific amino acids for optimization by site-directed mutagenesis. Optimization of residues in strands 7 and 8 of the β-barrel improved the quantum yield of Cerulean from 0.48 to 0.60. Further optimization by incorporating the wild-type T65S mutation in the chromophore improved the quantum yield to 0.87. This variant, mCerulean3, is 20\% brighter and shows greatly reduced fluorescence photoswitching behavior compared to the recently described mTurquoise fluorescent protein in vitro and in living cells. The fluorescence lifetime of mCerulean3 also fits to a single exponential time constant, making mCerulean3 a suitable choice for fluorescence lifetime microscopy experiments. Furthermore, inclusion of mCerulean3 in a fusion protein with mVenus produced FRET ratios with less variance than mTurquoise-containing fusions in living cells. Thus, mCerulean3 is a bright, photostable cyan fluorescent protein which possesses several characteristics that are highly desirable for FRET experiments.},

While its utility has been instrumental in progressing our knowledge of structures of molecules, it suffers from limitations such as the need for large, well-diffracting crystals, and radiation damage that can hamper native structural determination. The recent advent of X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and their implementation in the emerging field of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has given rise to a remarkable expansion upon existing crystallographic constraints, allowing structural biologists access to previously restricted scientific territory. SFX relies on exceptionally brilliant, micro-focused X-ray pulses, which are femtoseconds in duration, to probe nano/micrometer sized crystals in a serial fashion. This results in data sets comprised of individual snapshots, each capturing Bragg diffraction of single crystals in random orientations prior to their subsequent destruction. Thus structural elucidation while avoiding radiation damage, even at room temperature, can now be achieved. This emerging field has cultivated new methods for nanocrystallogenesis, sample delivery, and data processing. Opportunities and challenges within SFX are reviewed herein.},

To date, the number of serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) experiments has grown exponentially, with over 40 experiments reported so far. In this work, we report the first SSX experiments with viscous jets conducted at ALBA beamline BL13-XALOC. Small crystals (15–30 µm) of five soluble proteins (lysozyme, proteinase K, phycocyanin, insulin and α-spectrin-SH3 domain) were suspended in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) and delivered to the X-ray beam with a high-viscosity injector developed at Arizona State University. Complete data sets were collected from all proteins and their high-resolution structures determined. The high quality of the diffraction data collected from all five samples, and the lack of specific radiation damage in the structures obtained in this study, confirm that the current capabilities at the beamline enables atomic resolution determination of protein structures from microcrystals as small as 15 µm using viscous jets at room temperature. Thus, BL13-XALOC can provide a feasible alternative to X-ray free-electron lasers when determining snapshots of macromolecular structures.},

  abstract = {Crystal structure determination of biological macromolecules using the novel technique of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is severely limited by the scarcity of X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources. However, recent and future upgrades render microfocus beamlines at synchrotron-radiation sources suitable for room-temperature serial crystallography data collection also. Owing to the longer exposure times that are needed at synchrotrons, serial data collection is termed serial millisecond crystallography (SMX). As a result, the number of SMX experiments is growing rapidly, with a dozen experiments reported so far. Here, the first high-viscosity injector-based SMX experiments carried out at a US synchrotron source, the Advanced Photon Source (APS), are reported. Microcrystals (5–20 µm) of a wide variety of proteins, including lysozyme, thaumatin, phycocyanin, the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), the soluble fragment of the membrane lipoprotein Flpp3 and proteinase K, were screened. Crystals suspended in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) or a high-molecular-weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO; molecular weight 8 000 000) were delivered to the beam using a high-viscosity injector. In-house data-reduction (hit-finding) software developed at APS as well as the SFX data-reduction and analysis software suites Cheetah and CrystFEL enabled efficient on-site SMX data monitoring, reduction and processing. Complete data sets were collected for A2AAR, phycocyanin, Flpp3, proteinase K and lysozyme, and the structures of A2AAR, phycocyanin, proteinase K and lysozyme were determined at 3.2, 3.1, 2.65 and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively. The data demonstrate the feasibility of serial millisecond crystallography from 5–20 µm crystals using a high-viscosity injector at APS. The resolution of the crystal structures obtained in this study was dictated by the current flux density and crystal size, but upcoming developments in beamline optics and the planned APS-U upgrade will increase the intensity by two orders of magnitude.

  abstract = {Photolyases are flavoenzymes repairing UV-induced lesions in DNA, which may be activated by a photoreduction of their FAD cofactor. In most photolyases, this photoreduction proceeds by electron transfer along a chain of three tryptophan (Trp) residues, connecting the flavin to the protein surface. Much less studied, animal (6-4) photolyases (repairing pyrimidine–pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts) are particularly interesting as they were recently shown to have a longer electron transfer chain, counting four Trp residues. Using femtosecond polarized transient absorption spectroscopy, we performed a detailed analysis of the photoactivation reaction in the (6-4) photolyase of Xenopus laevis with oxidized FAD. We showed that the excited flavin is very quickly reduced (∼0.5 ps) by a nearby tryptophan residue, yielding FAD˙- and WH˙+ radicals. Subsequent kinetic steps in the picosecond regime were assigned to the migration of the positive charge along the Trp tetrad, in competition with charge recombination. We propose that the positive charge is actually delocalized over various Trp residues during most of the dynamics and that charge recombination essentially occurs through the proximal tryptophanyl radical. Oxidation of the fourth tryptophan is thought to be reached about as fast as that of the third one (∼40 ps), based on a comparison with a mutant protein lacking the distal Trp, implying ultrafast electron transfer between these two residues. This unusual mechanism sheds light on the rich diversity of electron transfer pathways found in various photolyases, and evolution-related cryptochromes alike.},

  abstract = {Bacteriorhodopsin, the sole membrane protein of the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum, functions as a light-driven proton pump. A 3-D crystal of bacteriorhodopsin, which was prepared by the membrane fusion method, was used to investigate structural changes in the primary photoreaction. It was observed that when a frozen crystal was exposed to a low flux of X-ray radiation (5×1014photonsmm-2), nearly half of the protein was converted into an orange species, exhibiting absorption peaks at 450nm, 478nm and 510nm. The remainder retained the normal photochemical activity until Asp85 in the active site was decarboxlyated by a higher flux of X-ray radiation (1016photonsmm-2). The procedure of diffraction measurement was improved so as to minimize the effects of the radiation damage and determine the true structural change associated with the primary photoreaction. Our structural model of the K intermediate indicates that the Schiff base linkage and the adjacent bonds in the polyene chain of retinal are largely twisted so that the Schiff base nitrogen atom still interacts with a water molecule located near Asp85. With respect to the other part of the protein, no appreciable displacement is induced in the primary photoreaction.},

As highly accurate models become available, generated by harnessing the power of correlated mutations and deep learning, one of the aspects of structural biology to be impacted will be methods of phasing in crystallography.

Some radicals have large extinction coefficients in the visible (VIS) range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be observed optically and spectrally. An online microspectrophotometer with high temporal resolution has been constructed that is capable of measuring UV/VIS absorption spectra (200–1100 nm) during X-ray data collection. The typical X-ray-induced blue colour that is characteristic of a wide range of cryo-conditions has been identified as trapped solvated electrons. Disulphide-containing proteins are shown to form disulphide radicals at millimolar concentrations, with absorption maxima around 400 nm. The solvated electrons and the disulphide radicals seem to have a lifetime in the range of seconds up to minutes at 100 K. The temperature dependence of the kinetics of X-ray-induced radical formation is different for the solvated electrons compared with the disulphide radicals. The online microspectrophotometer provides a technique complementary to X-ray diffraction for analysing and characterizing intermediates and redox states of proteins and enzymes.},

  abstract = {Serial X-ray crystallography allows macromolecular structure determination at both X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and, more recently, synchrotron sources. The time resolution for serial synchrotron crystallography experiments has been limited to millisecond timescales with monochromatic beams. The polychromatic, “pink”, beam provides a more than two orders of magnitude increased photon flux and hence allows accessing much shorter timescales in diffraction experiments at synchrotron sources. Here we report the structure determination of two different protein samples by merging pink-beam diffraction patterns from many crystals, each collected with a single 100\,ps X-ray pulse exposure per crystal using a setup optimized for very low scattering background. In contrast to experiments with monochromatic radiation, data from only 50 crystals were required to obtain complete datasets. The high quality of the diffraction data highlights the potential of this method for studying irreversible reactions at sub-microsecond timescales using high-brightness X-ray facilities.},

Altogether, our research highlights the utility of computational analysis of crystallographic data, makes publicly available dozens of new ligand-bound structures of a high-value drug target, and identifies novel aspects of ligandability and allostery in PTP1B.},

  abstract = {For the two proteins myoglobin and fluoroacetate dehalogenase, we present a systematic comparison of crystallographic diffraction data collected by serial femtosecond (SFX) and serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX). To maximize comparability, we used the same batch of micron-sized crystals, the same sample delivery device, and the same data analysis software. Overall figures of merit indicate that the data of both radiation sources are of equivalent quality. For both proteins, reasonable data statistics can be obtained with approximately 5000 room-temperature diffraction images irrespective of the radiation source. The direct comparability of SSX and SFX data indicates that the quality of diffraction data obtained from these samples is linked to the properties of the crystals rather than to the radiation source. Therefore, for other systems with similar properties, time-resolved experiments can be conducted at the radiation source that best matches the desired time resolution.},

  abstract = {Background Photolyases and cryptochromes are evolutionarily related flavoproteins, which however perform distinct physiological functions. Photolyases (PHR) are evolutionarily ancient enzymes. They are activated by light and repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. Although cryptochromes share structural similarity with DNA photolyases, they lack DNA repair activity. Cryptochrome (CRY) is one of the key elements of the circadian system in animals. In plants, CRY acts as a blue light receptor to entrain circadian rhythms, and mediates a variety of light responses, such as the regulation of flowering and seedling growth. Results We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the CRY/PHR superfamily. The superfamily consists of 7 major subfamilies: CPD class I and CPD class II photolyases, (6–4) photolyases, CRY-DASH, plant PHR2, plant CRY and animal CRY. Although the whole superfamily evolved primarily under strong purifying selection (average ω = 0.0168), some subfamilies did experience strong episodic positive selection during their evolution. Photolyases were lost in higher animals that suggests natural selection apparently became weaker in the late stage of evolutionary history. The evolutionary time estimates suggested that plant and animal CRYs evolved in the Neoproterozoic Era (\textasciitilde 1000–541 Mya), which might be a result of adaptation to the major climate and global light regime changes occurred in that period of the Earth’s geological history.},

Their detailed spectroscopy stems from a complex interplay between the electronic properties of a relatively simple, yet flexible and multiprotonable chromophore formed after specific biosynthesis, and the spatial and dynamic organization of its protein carrier. Early experimental and theoretical studies of GFP from the Aequorea victoria jellyfish and of model synthetic compounds have revealed that chromophore twisting, cis-trans isomerization, proton transfer, and electron transfer are major excited state reactions that determine its photophysics and photochemistry. It has been found later that quite similar mechanisms are at work in several distant members of the GFP family, suggesting a unified picture that may guide the future development of new GFP-based biosensors.},

  abstract = {A mutant form of mercuric reductase, which has three of its four catalytically essential cysteine residues replaced by alanines (ACAA: Alai35Cys140Ala558Ala559), has been constructed and used for mechanistic investigations. With disruption of the Hg(II) binding site, the mutant enzyme is devoid of Hg(II) reductase activity. However, it appears to fold properly since it binds FAD normally and exhibits very tight binding of pyridine nucleotides as is seen with the wild-type enzyme. This mutant enzyme allows quantitative accumulation of two species thought to function as intermediates in the catalytic sequence of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family of enzymes. NADPH reduces the flavin in this mutant, and a stabilized E-FADH" form accumulates. The second intermediate is a flavin C(4a)-Cys140 thiol adduct, which is quantitatively accumulated by reaction of oxidized ACAA enzyme with NADP+. The conversion of the Cys135-Cys140 disulfide in wild-type enzyme to the monothiol Cys140 in ACAA and the elevated pA"a of Cys140 (6.7 vs 5.0 in wild type) have permitted detection of these intermediates at low pH (5.0). The rates of formation of E-FADH" and the breakdown of the flavin C(4a)-thiol adduct have been measured and indicate that both intermediates are kinetically competent for both the reductive half-reaction and turnover by wild-type enzyme. These results validate the general proposal that electrons flow from NADPH to FADH" to C(4a)-thiol adduct to the FAD/dithiol form that accumulates as the EH2 form in the reductive half-reaction for this class of enzymes.},

The last is intimately linked with the nature of the pump–probe experiment itself, with the sources of random and, particularly, systematic experimental error, and with the factors that contribute to overall time resolution. All experiments to date have utilized the unchirped X-ray pulses that are emitted by synchrotron sources. Chirped pulses offer certain advantages for ultrafast X-ray experiments such as those based on Laue diffraction. An energy-chirped pulse maps photon energy into time; a Laue diffraction experiment maps photon energy into detector space. Hence, a Laue experiment with an energy-chirped pulse maps time into space. The proposed sub-picosecond photon source could provide an excellent source of intense, chirped hard X-rays for such experiments.},

In Laue diffraction, a stationary crystal is illuminated by a polychromatic X-ray source. Laue diffraction has inherent complications largely absent in monochromatic diffraction, and consequently fell into disuse for quantitative structure determination. However, the advent of naturally polychromatic, intense, pulsed storage ring X-ray sources in the 1970s led to re-examination at Daresbury and elsewhere of its underlying principles. Laue diffraction has been successfully applied at storage ring sources to time-resolved, pump–probe crystallographic studies, whose exposure time and time resolution were progressively reduced from minutes to seconds, milliseconds, nanoseconds and 100\,ps. Most recently, hard X-ray free electron laser sources have been used to generate narrow bandpass Laue diffraction patterns. The femtosecond X-ray pulses from such sources are completely destructive, generate only one diffraction pattern per tiny crystal and have unusual properties. However, they too are being applied to time-resolved crystallography to explore, for example, isomerization and rapid tertiary structural changes on the chemical, femtosecond timescale. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Fifty years of synchrotron science: achievements and opportunities’.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved X-ray crystallography and solution scattering have been successfully conducted on proteins on time-scales down to around 100 ps, set by the duration of the hard X-ray pulses emitted by synchrotron sources. The advent of hard X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), which emit extremely intense, very brief, coherent X-ray pulses, opens the exciting possibility of time-resolved experiments with femtosecond time resolution on macromolecular structure, in both single crystals and solution. The X-ray pulses emitted by an FEL differ greatly in many properties from those emitted by a synchrotron, in ways that at first glance make time-resolved measurements of X-ray scattering with the required accuracy extremely challenging. This opens up several questions which I consider in this brief overview. Are there likely to be chemically and biologically interesting structural changes to be revealed on the femtosecond time-scale? How shall time-resolved experiments best be designed and conducted to exploit the properties of FELs and overcome challenges that they pose? To date, fast time-resolved reactions have been initiated by a brief laser pulse, which obviously requires that the system under study be light-sensitive. Although this is true for proteins of the visual system and for signalling photoreceptors, it is not naturally the case for most interesting biological systems. To generate more biological targets for time-resolved study, can this limitation be overcome by optogenetic, chemical or other means?},

  abstract = {The photosensor YtvA binds flavin mononucleotide and regulates the general stress reaction in Bacillus subtilis in response to blue light illumination. It belongs to the family of light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) proteins that were first described in plant phototropins and form a subgroup of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) superfamily. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the LOV domain of YtvA in its dark and light states. The protein assumes the global fold common to all PAS domains and dimerizes via a hydrophobic interface. Directly C-terminal to the core of the LOV domain, an α-helix extends into the solvent. Light absorption causes formation of a covalent bond between a conserved cysteine residue and atom C(4a) of the FMN ring, which triggers rearrangements throughout the LOV domain. Concomitantly, in the dark and light structures, the two subunits of the dimeric protein rotate relative to each other by 5°. This small quaternary structural change is presumably a component of the mechanism by which the activity of YtvA is regulated in response to light. In terms of both structure and signaling mechanism, YtvA differs from plant phototropins and more closely resembles prokaryotic heme-binding PAS domains.},

This article presents a fast and optimized manufacturing route to metal–polyimide microfluidic flow-focusing devices which allow for the collection of X-ray diffraction data in flow. The flow-focusing conditions allow for sample consumption to be significantly decreased, while also opening up the possibility of more complex experiments such as rapid mixing for time-resolved serial crystallography. This high-repetition-rate experiment allows for full datasets to be obtained quickly (∼1 h) from crystal slurries in liquid flow. The X-ray compatible microfluidic chips are easily manufacturable, reliable and durable and require sample-flow rates on the order of only 30 µl h-1.},

  abstract = {High-throughput X-ray crystal structures of protein–ligand complexes are critical to pharmaceutical drug development. However, cryocooling of crystals and X-ray radiation damage may distort the observed ligand binding. Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) can produce radiation-damage-free room-temperature structures. Ligand-binding studies using SFX have received only modest attention, partly owing to limited beamtime availability and the large quantity of sample that is required per structure determination. Here, a high-throughput approach to determine room-temperature damage-free structures with excellent sample and time efficiency is demonstrated, allowing complexes to be characterized rapidly and without prohibitive sample requirements. This yields high-quality difference density maps allowing unambiguous ligand placement. Crucially, it is demonstrated that ligands similar in size or smaller than those used in fragment-based drug design may be clearly identified in data sets obtained from \&lt;1000 diffraction images. This efficiency in both sample and XFEL beamtime opens the door to true high-throughput screening of protein–ligand complexes using SFX.},

  abstract = {Chloride transport by microbial rhodopsins is an essential process for which molecular details such as the mechanisms that convert light energy to drive ion pumping and ensure the unidirectionality of the transport have remained elusive. We combined time-resolved serial crystallography with time-resolved spectroscopy and multiscale simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a chloride-pumping rhodopsin and the structural dynamics throughout the transport cycle. We traced transient anion-binding sites, obtained evidence for how light energy is used in the pumping mechanism, and identified steric and electrostatic molecular gates ensuring unidirectional transport. An interaction with the π-electron system of the retinal supports transient chloride ion binding across a major bottleneck in the transport pathway. These results allow us to propose key mechanistic features enabling finely controlled chloride transport across the cell membrane in this light-powered chloride ion pump.           ,              Movie of a moving chloride ion                            Biological pumps that use retinal isomerization to move protons across a membrane have been studied extensively, but the mechanisms involved in moving chloride ions, which have both a different charge and different coordination requirements, are less well understood. Mous               et al               . combined time-resolved x-ray crystallography, spectroscopy, and computational simulations to generate a molecular movie of chloride transport through a chloride-pumping halorhodopsin. Ion uptake from the extracellular environment is supported by interactions with the retinal, and transport through a space generated by retinal isomerization occurs within about 1 microsecond of excitation. Release of chloride and blockage of backward flow is mediated by a salt bridge that forms an electrostatic gate at the intracellular face. These insights are important for understanding ion transport in these pumps, which are important tools for optogenetic silencing of neurons. —MAF                        ,              A molecular movie reveals how ion transport is initiated and controlled in a chloride-pumping rhodopsin.},

  abstract = {The SwissFEL, a free electron laser (FEL) based next generation X-ray source, is being built at PSI. An XFEL poses several challenges to the detector development: in particular the single photon counting readout, a successful scheme in case of synchrotron sources, can not be used. At the same time the data quality of photon counting systems, i.e. the low noise and the high dynamic range, is essential from an experimental point of view. Detectors with these features are under development for the EU-XFEL in Hamburg, with the PSI SLS Detector group being involved in one of these efforts (AGIPD). The pulse train time structure of the EU-XFEL machine forces the need of in pixel image storage, resulting in pixel pitches in the 200 μm range. Since the SwissFEL is a 100 Hz repetition rate machine, this constrain is relaxed. For this reason, PSI is developing a 75 μm pitch pixel detector that, thanks to its automatic gain switching technique, will achieve single photon resolution and a high dynamic range. The detector is modular, with each module consisting of a 4 × 8 cm2 active sensor bump bonded to 8 readout ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), connected to a single printed circuit readout board with 10GbE link capabilities for data download. We have designed and tested a 48 × 48 pixel prototype produced in UMC110 nm technology. In this paper we present the general detector and ASIC design as well as the results of the prototype characterization measurements.},

It involves light absorption, electron transfer from an excited reduced and deprotonated FADH- to the flipped-out photolesion, followed by the fragmentation of the photolesions. Cryptochromes are highly related proteins that no longer repair damaged DNA, but function as photoreceptors. They feature strikingly similar protein architectures to photolyases and contain an FAD cofactor as well. However, cryptochromes possess an additional signal-transmitting domain, attached either to the N-termini or C-termini. Recently, the field of photorepair and blue-light photoperception has experienced significant progress particularly in structural biology, which is summarized in this review. Today, crystal structures of many family members are known and most recently even complexes of photolyases and DASH-type cryptochrome bound to their DNA substrates became available providing insight into the critical electron and energy transfer reactions that enable genome repair.},

  abstract = {Class II DNA photolyases are flavoenzymes occurring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes including higher plants and animals. Despite considerable structural deviations from the well-studied class I DNA photolyases, they share the main biological function, namely light-driven repair of the most common UV-induced lesions in DNA, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). For DNA repair activity, photolyases require the fully reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor, FADH-, which can be obtained from oxidized or semi-reduced FAD by a process called photoactivation. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we have examined the initial electron and proton transfer reactions leading to photoactivation of the class II DNA photolyase from Methanosarcina mazei. Upon photoexcitation, FAD is reduced via a distinct (class II-specific) chain of three tryptophans, giving rise to an FAD˙- TrpH˙+ radical pair. The distal Trp388H˙+ deprotonates to Trp388˙ in 350 ps, i.e., by three orders of magnitude faster than TrpH˙+ in aqueous solution or in any previously studied photolyase. We identified a class II-specific cluster of protein-bound water molecules ideally positioned to serve as the primary proton acceptor.

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which enzymes promote catalytic reactions efficiently through their structural changes remain to be fully elucidated. Recent progress in serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has made it possible to address these issues. In particular, mix-and-inject serial crystallography (MISC) is promising for the direct observation of structural changes associated with ongoing enzymic reactions. In this study, SFX measurements using a liquid-jet system were performed on microcrystals of bacterial copper amine oxidase anaerobically premixed with a substrate amine solution. The structure determined at 1.94\>Å resolution indicated that the peptidyl quinone cofactor is in equilibrium between the aminoresorcinol and semiquinone radical intermediates, which accumulate only under anaerobic single-turnover conditions. These results show that anaerobic conditions were well maintained throughout the liquid-jet SFX measurements, preventing the catalytic intermediates from reacting with dioxygen. These results also provide a necessary framework for performing time-resolved MISC to study enzymic reaction mechanisms under anaerobic conditions.},

  abstract = {Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains are responsible for detecting blue light (BL) and regulating the activities of effector domains in various organisms. Photozipper (PZ), an N-terminally truncated aureochrome-1 protein, contains a LOV domain and a basic leucin zipper (bZIP) domain and plays a role as a light-activatable transcription factor. PZ is monomeric in the dark state and undergoes non-covalent dimerization upon illumination with BL, subsequently increasing its affinity for the target DNA. To clarify the molecular mechanism of aureochromes, we prepared site-directed mutants of PZ and performed quantitative analyses in the dark and light states. Although the amino acid substitutions in the hinge region between the LOV core and A’α helix had minor effects on the dimerization and DNA-binding properties of PZ, the substitutions in the β-sheet region of the LOV core and in the A’α helix significantly affected these properties. We found that light signals are transmitted from the LOV core to the effector bZIP domain via the hydrophobic residues on the β-sheet. The light-induced conformational change possibly deforms the hydrophobic regions of the LOV core and induces the detachment of the A’α helix to expose the dimerization surface, likely activating the bZIP domain in a light-dependent manner.},

Coherent oscillations of the wave packet were directly observed in the two-dimensional time-energy map of ultrafast fluorescence with 180fs time resolution and 5nm spectral resolution. The two-dimensional map revealed that four or more oscillatory components exist within the broad bandwidth of the fluorescence spectrum, each of which is restricted in the respective narrow spectral region. Typical frequencies of the oscillatory modes are 50 and 120cm-1. In the landscape on the map, the oscillatory components were recognized as the ridges which were winding and descending with time. The amplitude of the oscillatory and winding behaviors is a few hundred cm-1, which is the same order as the frequencies of the oscillations. The mean spectral positions of the oscillatory components in the two-dimensional map are well explained by considering the vibrational energies of intramolecular modes in the electronic ground state of the chromophore. The entire view of the wave packet oscillations and broadening in the electronic excited state, accompanied by fluorescence transitions to the vibrational sublevels belonging to the electronic ground state, was obtained.},

Phot2 is composed of two light-oxygen-voltage sensing domains (LOV1 and LOV2) to absorb BL, and a kinase domain. Photo-activated LOV domains, especially LOV2, play a major role in photo-dependent increase in the phosphorylation activity of the kinase domain. The atomic details of the overall structure of phot2 and the intramolecular mechanism to convert BL energy to a phosphorylation signal remain unknown. We performed structural studies on the LOV fragments LOV1, LOV2, LOV2-linker, and LOV2-kinase, and full-length phot2, using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The aim of the study was to understand structural changes under BL irradiation and discuss the molecular mechanism that enhance the phosphorylation activity under BL. SAXS is a suitable technique for visualizing molecular structures of proteins in solution at low resolution and is advantageous for monitoring their structural changes in the presence of external physical and/or chemical stimuli. Structural parameters and molecular models of the recombinant specimens were obtained from SAXS profiles in the dark, under BL irradiation, and after dark reversion. LOV1, LOV2, and LOV2-linker fragments displayed minimal structural changes. However, BL-induced rearrangements of functional domains were noted for LOV2-kinase and full-length phot2. Based on the molecular model together with the absorption measurements and biochemical assays, we discuss the intramolecular interactions and domain motions necessary for BL-enhanced phosphorylation activity of phot2.},

  abstract = {Conformational changes of Arabidopsis phot1-LOV2 with the linker (phot1-LOV2-linker) were investigated from the viewpoint of the changes in molecular volume and molecular diffusion coefficient (D) by time-resolved transient grating (TG) and transient lens (TrL) methods. Although the absorption spectrum change completes within a few microseconds, the D-value detected by the TG method decreased drastically with a time constant of 1.0~ms from 9.2(±0.4)×10-11 m2/s to 5.0(±0.3)×10-11 m2/s. This time-dependent D was interpreted in terms of the unfolding of α-helices in the linker region. The change of the α-helices was confirmed by observing the recovery of the circular dichroism intensity. The TrL signal showed that the molecular volume decreases with two time constants; 300~μs and 1.0~ms. The former time constant is close to the previously observed photo-dissociation reaction rate of the phot1-LOV2 (without the linker) dimer, and the latter one agrees well with the rate of the D-change. Considering a similar time constant of the dissociation reaction of the LOV2 dimer, we interpreted these kinetics in terms of the dissociation step of the linker region from the LOV2 domain (T390pre state). After this step, the protein volume and D are decreased significantly with the lifetime of 1.0~ms. The D decrease indicates the increase of the intermolecular interaction between the protein and water molecules. On the basis of these observations, a two-step mechanism of the linker unfolding is proposed.},

The fixed-target (FT) scanning approach is one method for SX sample delivery that minimizes sample consumption and minimizes physical damage to crystals during data collection. Settling of the crystals on the sample holder in random orientation is important for complete three dimensional data collection. To increase the random orientation of crystals on the sample holder, we developed a polyimide mesh-based sample holder with irregular crystal mounting holes for FT-SX. The polyimide mesh was fabricated using a picosecond laser. Each hole in the polyimide mesh has irregularly shaped holes because of laser thermal damage, which may cause more crystals to settle at random orientations compared to regular shaped sample holders. A crystal sample was spread onto a polyimide-mesh, and a polyimide film was added to both sides to prevent dehydration. Using this sample holder, FT-SX was performed at synchrotron and determined the room-temperature lysozyme structure at 1.65~Å. The polyimide mesh with irregularly shaped holes will allow for expanded applications in sample delivery for FT-SX experiments.},

  abstract = {Proteins that contain metal cofactors are expected to be highly radiation sensitive since the degree of X-ray absorption correlates with the presence of high-atomic-number elements and X-ray energy. To explore the effects of local damage in serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), Clostridium ferredoxin was used as a model system. The protein contains two [4Fe–4S] clusters that serve as sensitive probes for radiation-induced electronic and structural changes. High-dose room-temperature SFX datasets were collected at the Linac Coherent Light Source of ferredoxin microcrystals. Difference electron density maps calculated from high-dose SFX and synchrotron data show peaks at the iron positions of the clusters, indicative of decrease of atomic scattering factors due to ionization. The electron density of the two [4Fe–4S] clusters differs in the FEL data, but not in the synchrotron data. Since the clusters differ in their detailed architecture, this observation is suggestive of an influence of the molecular bonding and geometry on the atomic displacement dynamics following initial photoionization. The experiments are complemented by plasma code calculations.},

Here we used time-resolved crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser to follow the structural changes in multiphoton-excited bR from 250 femtoseconds to 10 picoseconds. Quantum chemistry and ultrafast spectroscopy were used to identify a sequential two-photon absorption process, leading to excitation of a tryptophan residue flanking the retinal chromophore, as a first manifestation of multiphoton effects. We resolve distinct stages in the structural dynamics of the all-trans retinal in photoexcited bR to a highly twisted 13-cis conformation. Other active site sub-picosecond rearrangements include correlated vibrational motions of the electronically excited retinal chromophore, the surrounding amino acids and water molecules as well as their hydrogen bonding network. These results show that this extended photo-active network forms an electronically and vibrationally coupled system in bR, and most likely in all retinal proteins.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) enable crystallographic structure determination beyond the limitations imposed upon synchrotron measurements by radiation damage. The need for very short XFEL pulses is relieved through gating of Bragg diffraction by loss of crystalline order as damage progresses, but not if ionization events are spatially non-uniform due to underlying elemental distributions, as in biological samples. Indeed, correlated movements of iron and sulfur ions were observed in XFEL-irradiated ferredoxin microcrystals using unusually long pulses of 80\,fs. Here, we report a femtosecond time-resolved X-ray pump/X-ray probe experiment on protein nanocrystals. We observe changes in the protein backbone and aromatic residues as well as disulfide bridges. Simulations show that the latter’s correlated structural dynamics are much slower than expected for the predicted high atomic charge states due to significant impact of ion caging and plasma electron screening. This indicates that dense-environment effects can strongly affect local radiation damage-induced structural dynamics.},

  abstract = {To obtain insight into the effects of the environment on the photophysics and photochemistry of the green fluorescence protein (GFP), eight crystal structures of six synthetic aryl-substituted analogues (2-fluoro, 2-methyl, 3-hydroxy, 3-methoxy, 2,4-dimethyl and 2,5-dimethyl) of the GFP chromophore (4-hydroxy-benzylidenedimethylimidazolinone) were determined and correlated with their two-dimensional steady-state and time-resolved solid-state excitation-emission spectra. The stacking between the molecules greatly affected the emission energy and the lifetime of the emission of the chromophore, implying that π—π interactions could be critical for the photophysics of GFP. The reaction pathways were dependent on the excitation energy, resulting either in [2 + 2] photodimerization at the bridging double bond (UV excitation) or flipping of the imidazolone ring (visible excitation). The meta-hydroxy chromophore (3-HOBDI) was the only GFP-chromophore analogue that was obtained as more than one stable polymorph in the pure state thus far. Due to the asymmetric substitution with hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, 3-HOBDI is tetramorphic, the forms showing distinctly different structure and behavior: (1) while one of the polymorphs (3-HOBDI-A), having multilayer structure with alternating stereochemistry of linear hydrogen-bonded motifs, undergoes photodimerization under UV light, (2) another (3-HOBDI-C), which has dimeric head-to-tail structure, shows Z-to-E isomerization via τ-one-bond flip of the imidazolone ring by excitation in the visible region. X-ray diffraction analysis of a partially reacted single crystal of 3-HOBDI-C provided the first direct evidence of τ-one-bond flip occurring in a GFP-like compound. Moreover, the cooperative action of the photodimerization of 3-HOBDI-A appears as a photomechanical effect of unprecedented magnitude for a single crystalline specimen, where photoexcited single crystals bend to more than 90° without breaking.},

  abstract = {The primary event which occurs when an X-ray photon of energy less than 30 keV is absorbed in a protein crystal (or other organic material) is the production of a photoelectron with a similar energy to that of the absorbed photon. The electron then scatters inelastically off the surrounding material losing energy in the process. This reduction in energy takes place over track lengths of a few µm for 20 keV electrons. The vector distances between the initial and final positions of the photoelectrons are less than the track lengths owing to the non-linear tracks followed by the electrons. For crystals with smaller dimensions than the vector distances, a significant proportion of the energy could leave the crystal with the high-energy electrons. This could provide an advantage in terms of reduced radiation damage. In order to estimate the possible benefits, calculations of the electron tracks are given, initially using the continuous slowing-down approximation. A Monte Carlo approach is then used to provide more accurate values of the vector distance travelled by electrons inside a protein crystal. The calculations indicate that significant reductions in radiation damage could occur for crystals of a few µm in size. The benefits would be greater when operating at higher energies. In addition, a scheme for realising the possible benefits in a practical situation is described. This could then form the basis of trial experiments.},

  abstract = {Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains are conserved parts of photoreceptors in plants, bacteria and fungi that bind flavins as chromophores and detect blue light. In the past, LOV domain variants have been developed as fluorescent reporter proteins (called flavin-based fluorescent proteins; FbFPs), which due to their ability to fluoresce under anaerobic conditions, fast folding kinetics and a small size of ∼12–16 kDa are a promising reporter system for quantitative real-time analysis of biological processes. Here, we present a small thermostable flavin-based fluorescent protein CagFbFP derived from a soluble LOV domain-containing histidine kinase from the thermophilic bacterium Chloroflexus aggregans. CagFbFP is composed of 107 amino acids with a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa and consists only of the conserved LOV core domain. The protein is thermostable with a melting point of about 68 °C. It crystallizes easily and its crystals diffract to 1.07 Å. Both the crystal structure and small angle scattering data show that the protein is a dimer. Unexpectedly, glutamine 148, which in LOV photoreceptor proteins is the key residue responsible for signal transduction, occupies two conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the two conformations interconvert rapidly. The crystal structure of the wild-type Chloroflexus aggregans LOV domain determined at 1.22 Å resolution confirmed the presence of two alternative conformations of the glutamine 148 side chain. Overall, this protein, due to its stability and ease of crystallization, appears to be a promising model for ultra-high resolution structural studies of LOV domains and for application as a fluorescent reporter.},

  abstract = {Recent 3-D structures of several intermediates in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) provide a detailed structural picture of this molecular proton pump in action. In this review, we describe the sequence of conformational changes of bR following the photoisomerization of its all-trans retinal chromophore, which is covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to Lys216 in helix G, to a 13-cis configuration. The initial changes are localized near the protein's active site and a key water molecule is disordered. This water molecule serves as a keystone for the ground state of bR since, within the framework of the complex counter ion, it is important both for stabilizing the structure of the extracellular half of the protein, and for maintaining the high pKa of the Schiff base (the primary proton donor) and the low pKa of Asp85 (the primary proton acceptor). Subsequent structural rearrangements propagate out from the active site towards the extracellular half of the protein, with a local flex of helix C exaggerating an early movement of Asp85 towards the Schiff base, thereby facilitating proton transfer between these two groups. Other coupled rearrangements indicate the mechanism of proton release to the extracellular medium. On the cytoplasmic half of the protein, a local unwinding of helix G near the backbone of Lys216 provides sites for water molecules to order and define a pathway for the reprotonation of the Schiff base from Asp96 later in the photocycle. A steric clash of the photoisomerized retinal with Trp182 in helix F drives an outward tilt of the cytoplasmic half of this helix, opening the proton transport channel and enabling a proton to be taken up from the cytoplasm. Although bR is the first integral membrane protein to have its catalytic mechanism structurally characterized in detail, several key results were anticipated in advance of the structural model and the general framework for vectorial proton transport has, by and large, been preserved.},

Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements1,2. Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation3,4,5 suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12\,keV energy or 1\,Å wavelength2) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers6,7 that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

Hence, it is important to build accurate, reliable models of ligands that give confidence in the interpretation of the respective protein–ligand complex.

The CCP4 suite contains a number of software tools that facilitate this task: AceDRG for the creation of ligand descriptions and conformers, Lidia and JLigand for two-dimensional and three-dimensional ligand editing and visual analysis, Coot for density interpretation, ligand fitting, analysis and validation, and REFMAC5 for macromolecular refinement. In addition to recent advancements in automatic carbohydrate building in Coot (LO/Carb) and ligand-validation tools (FLEV), the release of the CCP4i2 GUI provides an integrated solution that streamlines the ligand-fitting workflow, seamlessly passing results from one program to the next. The ligand-fitting process is illustrated using instructive practical examples, including problematic cases such as post-translational modifications, highlighting the need for careful analysis and rigorous validation.},

Here, the adaptation of this technology to perform serial millisecond crystallography (SMX) at more widely available synchrotron microfocus beamlines is described.

The technology is demonstrated by solving a structure of the light-driven proton-pump bacteriorhodopsin (bR) at a resolution of 2.4 Å. The room-temperature structure of bR is very similar to previous cryogenic structures but shows small yet distinct differences in the retinal ligand and proton-transfer pathway.},

Accumulation of M intermediate within the crystal lattice is confirmed by time-resolved visible absorption spectroscopy.

  abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) reductase from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum is a P450-type enzyme (P450nor) that catalyzes the reduction of NO to nitrous oxide (N2O) in the global nitrogen cycle. In this enzymatic reaction, the heme-bound NO is activated by the direct hydride transfer from NADH to generate a short-lived intermediate (I), a key state to promote N–N bond formation and N–O bond cleavage. This study applied time-resolved (TR) techniques in conjunction with photolabile-caged NO to gain direct experimental results for the characterization of the coordination and electronic structures of I. TR freeze-trap crystallography using an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) reveals highly bent Fe–NO coordination in I, with an elongated Fe–NO bond length (Fe–NO = 1.91 Å, Fe–N–O = 138°) in the absence of NAD+. TR-infrared (IR) spectroscopy detects the formation of I with an N–O stretching frequency of 1,290 cm-1 upon hydride transfer from NADH to the Fe3+–NO enzyme via the dissociation of NAD+ from a transient state, with an N–O stretching of 1,330 cm-1 and a lifetime of ca. 16 ms. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, based on these crystallographic and IR spectroscopic results, demonstrate that the electronic structure of I is characterized by a singly protonated Fe3+–NHO•- radical. The current findings provide conclusive evidence for the N2O generation mechanism via a radical–radical coupling of the heme nitroxyl complex with the second NO molecule.},

We performed time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallographic analyses of ChR by using an X-ray free electron laser, which revealed conformational changes following photoactivation. The isomerized retinal adopts a twisted conformation and shifts toward the putative internal proton donor residues, consequently inducing an outward shift of TM3, as well as a local deformation in TM7. These early conformational changes in the pore-forming helices should be the triggers that lead to opening of the ion conducting pore.},

  abstract = {Phototropin2 (phot2) is a blue-light (BL) receptor that regulates BL-dependent activities for efficient photosynthesis in plants. phot2 comprises two BL-receiving light-oxygen-voltage–sensing domains (LOV1 and LOV2) and a kinase domain. BL-excited LOV2 is thought to be primarily responsible for the BL-dependent activation of the kinase. However, the molecular mechanisms by which small BL-induced conformational changes in the LOV2 domain are transmitted to the kinase remain unclear. Here, we used full-length wild-type and mutant phot2 proteins from Arabidopsis to study their molecular properties in the dark and under BL irradiation. Phosphorylation assays and absorption measurements indicated that the LOV1 domain assists the thermal relaxation of BL-excited LOV2 and vice versa. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy, we observed that phot2 forms a dimer and has a rod shape with a maximum length of 188 Å and a radius of gyration of 44 Å. Under BL, phot2 displayed large conformational changes that bent the rod shape. By superimposing the crystal structures of the LOV1 dimer, LOV2, and a homology model of the kinase to the observed changes, we inferred that the BL-dependent change consisted of positional shifts of both LOV2 and the kinase relative to LOV1. Furthermore, phot2 mutants lacking the photocycle in LOV1 or LOV2 still exhibited conformational changes under BL, suggesting that LOV1 and LOV2 cooperatively contribute to the conformational changes that activate the kinase. These results suggest that BL-activated LOV1 contributes to the kinase activity of phot2. We discuss the possible intramolecular interactions and signaling mechanisms in phot2.},

A LOV domain harbors a flavin mononucleotide that undergoes a cyclic photoreaction upon BL excitation via a signaling state in which the inhibition of the kinase activity by LOV2 is negated. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the BL-dependent activation of the kinase, the photochemistry, kinase activity, and molecular structure were studied with the phot of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Full-length and LOV2-KD samples of C. reinhardtii phot showed cyclic photoreaction characteristics with the activation of LOV- and BL-dependent kinase. Truncation of LOV1 decreased the photosensitivity of the kinase activation, which was well explained by the fact that the signaling state lasted for a shorter period of time compared with that of the phot. Small angle x-ray scattering revealed monomeric forms of the proteins in solution and detected BL-dependent conformational changes, suggesting an extension of the global molecular shapes of both samples. Constructed molecular model of full-length phot based on the small angle x-ray scattering data proved the arrangement of LOV1, LOV2, and KD for the first time that showed a tandem arrangement both in the dark and under BL irradiation. The models suggest that LOV1 alters its position relative to LOV2-KD under BL irradiation. This finding demonstrates that LOV1 may interact with LOV2 and modify the photosensitivity of the kinase activation through alteration of the duration of the signaling state in LOV2.},

Arabidopsis has two homologues, phot1 and phot2, that share physiological functions depending on light intensity. A phot molecule has two photoreceptive light oxygen voltage-sensing domains, LOV1 and LOV2, and a Ser/Thr kinase domain. The LOV domains undergo a photocycle upon blue light (BL) stimulation, including transient adduct formation between the chromophore and a conserved cysteine (S390 intermediate) that leads to activation of the kinase. To uncover the mechanism underlying the photoactivation of the kinase, we have introduced a kinase assay system composed of a phot1 LOV2-linker-kinase polypeptide as a light-regulated kinase and its N-terminal polypeptide as an artificial substrate (Okajima, K., Matsuoka, D., and Tokutomi, S. (2011) LOV2-linker-kinase phosphorylates LOV1-containing N-terminal polypeptide substrate via photoreaction of LOV2 in Arabidopsis phototropin1. FEBS Lett. 585, 3391–3395). In the present study, we extended the assay system to phot2 and compared the photochemistry and kinase activation by BL between phot1 and phot2 to gain insight into the molecular basis for the different photosensitivities of phot1 and phot2. Photosensitivity of kinase activation by BL and the lifetime of S390 of phot1 were 10 times higher and longer, respectively, than those of phot2. This correlation was confirmed by an amino acid substitution experiment with phot1 to shorten the lifetime of S390. The present results demonstrated that the photosensitivity of kinase activation in phot involves the lifetime of S390 in LOV2, suggesting that the lifetime is one of the key factors for the different photosensitivities observed for phot1 and phot2.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Cryptochromes constitute a group of flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. Recently, the response of cryptochromes to light was extended to nearly the entire visible spectral region on the basis of the activity of the animal-like cryptochrome aCRY in the green alga \emph{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}. This finding was explained by the absorption of red light by the flavin neutral radical as the dark state of the receptor, which then forms the anionic fully reduced state. In this study, time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy on the full-length aCRY revealed an unusually long-lived tyrosyl radical with a lifetime of 2.6 s, which is present already 1 μs after red light illumination of the flavin radical. Mutational studies disclosed the tyrosine 373 close to the surface to form the long-lived radical and to be essential for photoreduction. This residue is conserved exclusively in the sequences of other putative aCRY proteins distinguishing them from conventional (6–4) photolyases. Size exclusion chromatography showed the full-length aCRY to be a dimer in the dark at 0.5 mm injected concentration with the C-terminal extension as the dimerization site. Upon illumination, partial oligomerization was observed via disulfide bridge formation at cysteine 482 in close proximity to tyrosine 373. The lack of any light response in the C-terminal extension as evidenced by FTIR spectroscopy differentiates aCRY from plant and \emph{Drosophila} cryptochromes. These findings imply that aCRY might have evolved a different signaling mechanism via a light-triggered redox cascade culminating in photooxidation of a yet unknown substrate or binding partner.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ever since the first atomic structure of an enzyme was solved, the discovery of the mechanism and dynamics of reactions catalyzed by biomolecules has been the key goal for the understanding of the molecular processes that drive life on earth. Despite a large number of successful methods for trapping reaction intermediates, the direct observation of an ongoing reaction has been possible only in rare and exceptional cases. Here, we demonstrate a general method for capturing enzyme catalysis “in action” by mix-and-inject serial crystallography (MISC). Specifically, we follow the catalytic reaction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis β-lactamase with the third-generation antibiotic ceftriaxone by time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography. The results reveal, in near atomic detail, antibiotic cleavage and inactivation from 30 ms to 2 s. MISC is a versatile and generally applicable method to investigate reactions of biological macromolecules, some of which are of immense biological significance and might be, in addition, important targets for structure-based drug design. With megahertz X-ray pulse rates expected at the Linac Coherent Light Source II and the European X-ray free-electron laser, multiple, finely spaced time delays can be collected rapidly, allowing a comprehensive description of biomolecular reactions in terms of structure and kinetics from the same set of X-ray data.},

Whereas an increasing number of structures solved by means of serial femtosecond crystallography at XFELs is available, the effect of radiation damage on protein crystals during ultrafast exposures has remained an open question. We used a split-and-delay line based on diffractive X-ray optics at the Linac Coherent Light Source XFEL to investigate the time dependence of X-ray radiation damage to lysozyme crystals. For these tests, crystals were delivered to the X-ray beam using a fixed-target approach. The presented experiments provide probe signals at eight different delay times between 19 and 213 femtoseconds after a single pump event, thereby covering the time-scales relevant for femtosecond serial crystallography. Even though significant impact on the crystals was observed at long time scales after exposure with a single X-ray pulse, the collected diffraction data did not show significant signal reduction that could be assigned to beam damage on the crystals in the sampled time window and resolution range. This observation is in agreement with estimations of the applied radiation dose, which in our experiment was clearly below the values expected to cause damage on the femtosecond time scale. The experiments presented here demonstrate the feasibility of time-resolved pump-multiprobe X-ray diffraction experiments on protein crystals.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases catalyze the oxidation of carbonylic substrates to ester or lactone products using NADPH as electron donor and molecular oxygen as oxidative reactant. Using protein engineering, kinetics, microspectrophotometry, crystallography, and intermediate analogs, we have captured several snapshots along the catalytic cycle which highlight key features in enzyme catalysis. After acting as electron donor, the enzyme-bound NADP(H) forms an H-bond with the flavin cofactor. This interaction is critical for stabilizing the oxygen-activating flavin-peroxide intermediate that results from the reaction of the reduced cofactor with oxygen. An essential active-site arginine acts as anchoring element for proper binding of the ketone substrate. Its positively charged guanidinium group can enhance the propensity of the substrate to undergo a nucleophilic attack by the flavin-peroxide intermediate. Furthermore, the arginine side chain, together with the NADP\textsuperscript{+} ribose group, forms the niche that hosts the negatively charged Criegee intermediate that is generated upon reaction of the substrate with the flavin-peroxide. The fascinating ability of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases to catalyze a complex multistep catalytic reaction originates from concerted action of this Arg-NADP(H) pair and the flavin subsequently to promote flavin reduction, oxygen activation, tetrahedral intermediate formation, and product synthesis and release. The emerging picture is that these enzymes are mainly oxygen-activating and "Criegee-stabilizing" catalysts that act on any chemically suitable substrate that can diffuse into the active site, emphasizing their potential value as toolboxes for biocatalytic applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Crystal structures of Pseudomonas putida 3,4-PCD [quaternary structure of (αβFe3+)12] complexed with seven competitive inhibitors [3-hydroxyphenylacetate (MHP), 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (PHP), 3-hydroxybenzoate (MHB), 4-hydroxybenzoate (PHB), 3-fluoro-4-hydroxybenzoate (FHB), 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate (CHB), and 3-iodo-4-hydroxybenzoate (IHB)] are reported at 2.0-2.2 Å resolution with R-factors of 0.159-0.179. The inhibitors bind in a narrow active site crevasse lined with residues that provide a microenvironment that closely matches the chemical characteristics of the inhibitors. This results in as little as 20\% solvent-exposed surface area for the higher-affinity inhibitors (PHB, CHB, and FHB). In uncomplexed 3,4-PCD, the active site Fe3+ is bound at the bottom of the active site crevasse by four endogenous ligands and a solvent molecule (Wat827). The orientations of the endogenous ligands are relatively unperturbed in each inhibitor complex, but the inhibitors themselves bind to or near the iron in a range of positions, all of which perturb the position of Wat827. The three lowest-affinity inhibitors (MHP, PHP, and IHB) yield distorted trigonal bipyramidal iron coordination geometry in which the inhibitor C4-phenolate group displaces the solvent ligand. MHB binds within the active site, but neither its C3-OH group nor the solvent molecule binds to the iron. The C4-phenolate group of the three highest-affinity inhibitors (PHB, CHB, and FHB) coordinates the Fe3+ adjacent to Wat827, resulting in a shift in its position to yield a six-coordinate distorted octahedral geometry. The range of inhibitor orientations may mimic the mechanistically significant stages of substrate binding to 3,4-PCD. The structure of the final substrate complex is reported in the following paper [Orville, A. M., Lipscomb, J. D., \& Ohlendorf, D. H. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 10052-10066].},

A plethora of fixed targets have been developed at different facilities and by various manufacturers, with different characteristics and dimensions and with little or no emphasis on standardization. These many fixed targets have good reasons for their design, shapes, fabrication materials and the presence or absence of apertures and fiducials, reflecting the diversity of serial experiments. Given this, it would be a Sisyphean task to design and manufacture a new standard fixed target that would satisfy all possible experimental configurations. Therefore, a simple standardized descriptor to fully describe fixed targets is proposed rather than a standardized device. This descriptor is a dictionary that could be read by fixed-target beamline software and straightforwardly allow data collection from fixed targets new to that beamline. The descriptor would therefore allow a much easier exchange of fixed targets between sources and facilitate the uptake of new fixed targets, benefiting beamlines, users and manufacturers. This descriptor was first presented at, and was developed following, a meeting of representatives from multiple synchrotron and XFEL sources in Hamburg in January 2023.},

Upon light absorption, dCRY undergoes a conformational change that enables it to bind to Timeless (dTIM), as well as to two different E3 ligases that ubiquitylate dTIM and dCRY, respectively, resulting in their proteolysis and resetting the phase of the circadian rhythm. Purified dCRY contains oxidized flavin (FADox), which is readily photoreduced to the anionic semiquinone through a set of 3 highly conserved Trp residues (Trp triad). The crystal structure of dCRY has revealed a fourth Trp (Trp-536) as a potential electron donor. Previously, we reported that the Trp triad played no role in photoinduced proteolysis of dCRY in Drosophila cells. Here we investigated the role of the Trp triad and Trp-536, and the redox status of the flavin on light-induced proteolysis of both dCRY and dTIM and resetting of the clock. We found that both oxidized (FADox) and reduced (FAD⨪) forms of dCRY undergo light-induced conformational change in vitro that enable dCRY to bind JET and that Trp triad and Trp-536 mutations that block known or presumed intraprotein electron transfer reactions do not affect dCRY phototransduction under bright or dim light in vivo as measured by light-induced proteolysis of dCRY and dTIM in Drosophila S2R+ cells. We conclude that both oxidized and reduced forms of dCRY are capable of photosignaling.},

  abstract = {The photolyase/cryptochrome family is a large family of flavoproteins that encompasses DNA repair proteins, photolyases, and cryptochromes that regulate blue-light-dependent growth and development in plants, and light-dependent and light-independent circadian clock setting in animals. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed a new class of the family, named type III photolyase, which cosegregates with plant cryptochromes. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a type III photolyase from Caulobacter crescentus. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the enzyme contains both the methenyl tetrahydrofolate photoantenna and the FAD catalytic cofactor. Biochemical analysis shows that it is a bona fide photolyase that repairs cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Mutation of an active site Trp to Arg disrupts FAD binding with no measurable effect on MTHF binding. Using enzyme preparations that contain either both chromophores or only folate, we were able to determine the efficiency and rate of transfer of energy from MTHF to FAD.},

The high repetition rate of the EuXFEL combined with our mix-and-inject technology enables the initial phase of ceftriaxone binding to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis β-lactamase to be followed using time-resolved crystallography in real time. It is shown how a diffusion coefficient in enzyme crystals can be derived directly from the X-ray data, enabling the determination of ligand and enzyme–ligand concentrations at any position in the crystal volume as a function of time. In addition, the structure of the irreversible inhibitor sulbactam bound to the enzyme at a 66 ms time delay after mixing is described. This demonstrates that the EuXFEL can be used as an important tool for biomedically relevant research.},

Time-resolved crystallographic investigations on biological macromolecules belong to an important class of experiments that explore fundamental and functional structural displacements in these molecules.

The reaction is initiated by blue light and proceeds through long-range energy transfer, single electron transfer, and enzyme catalysis by a radical mechanism. The three-dimensional crystallographic structure of DNA photolyase from Escherichia coli is presented and the atomic model was refined to an R value of 0.172 at 2.3 Å resolution. The polypeptide chain of 471 amino acids is folded into an amino-terminal α/βdomain resembling dinucleotide binding domains and a carboxyl-terminal helical domain; a loop of 72 residues connects the domains. The light-harvesting cofactor 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF) binds in a cleft between the two domains. Energy transfer from MTHF to the catalytic cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) occurs over a distance of 16.8 Å. The FAD adopts a U-shaped conformation between two helix clusters in the center of the helical domain and is accessible through a hole in the surface of this domain. Dimensions and polarity of the hole match those of a Pyr {$<>$} Pyr dinucleotide, suggesting that the Pyr {$<>$} Pyr "flips out" of the helix to fit into this hole, and that electron transfer between the flavin and the Pyr {$<>$} Pyr occurs over van der Waals contact distance.}

Among a variety of photoproducts, cyclobutane-type pyrimidine photodimers (CPD) are the most abundant primary lesion. Despite its biological importance, the precise relationship between the structure and properties of DNA containing CPD has remained to be elucidated. Here, we report the free (unbound) crystal structure of duplex DNA containing a CPD lesion at a resolution of 2.0 Å. Our crystal structure shows that the overall helical axis bends ≈30° toward the major groove and unwinds ≈9°, in remarkable agreement with some previous theoretical and experimental studies. There are also significant differences in local structure compared with standard B-DNA, including pinching of the minor groove at the 3′ side of the CPD lesion, a severe change of the base pair parameter in the 5′ side, and serious widening of both minor and major groves both 3′ and 5′ of the CPD. Overall, the structure of the damaged DNA differs from undamaged DNA to an extent that DNA repair proteins may recognize this conformation, and the various components of the replicational and transcriptional machinery may be interfered with due to the perturbed local and global structure.},

  abstract = {Serial crystallography (SX) technique using synchrotron X-ray allows the visualization of room-temperature crystal structures with low-dose data collection as well as time-resolved molecular dynamics. In an SX experiment, delivery of numerous crystals for X-ray interaction, in a serial manner, is very important. Fixed-target scanning approach has the advantage of dramatically minimizing sample consumption as well as any physical damage to crystal sample, compared to other sample delivery methods. Here, we introduce the simple approach of fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (FT-SSX) using nylon mesh and enclosed film (NAM)-based sample holder. The NAM-based sample holder consisted of X-ray-transparent nylon-mesh and polyimide film, attached to a magnetic base. This sample holder was mounted to a goniometer head on macromolecular crystallography beamline, and translated along vertical and horizontal directions for raster scanning by the goniometer. Diffraction data were collected in two raster scanning approaches: (i) 100 ms X-ray exposure and 0.011° oscillation at each scan point and (ii) 500 ms X-ray exposure and 0.222° oscillation at each scan point. Using this approach, we determined the room-temperature crystal structures of lysozyme and glucose isomerase at 1.5–2.0 Å resolution. The sample holder produced negligible X-ray background scattering for data processing. Therefore, the new approach provided an opportunity to perform FT-SSX with high accessibility using macromolecular crystallography beamlines at synchrotron without any special equipment.},

  abstract = {Cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors that regulate a variety of responses such as growth and circadian rhythms in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Cryptochromes share a high level of sequence identity with the light-activated DNA repair enzyme photolyase. Photolyase uses energy from blue light to repair UV-induced photoproducts in DNA through cyclic electron transfer between the catalytic flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and the damaged DNA. Cryptochromes lack DNA repair activity, and their mechanism of signal transduction is not known. It is hypothesized that a light-dependent signaling state in cryptochromes is created as a result of an intramolecular redox reaction, resulting in conformational rearrangement and effector binding. Plant and animal cryptochromes possess 30-250 amino acid carboxy-terminal extensions beyond the photolyase-homology region that have been shown to mediate phototransduction. We analyzed the structures of C-terminal domains from an animal and a plant cryptochrome by computational, biophysical, and biochemical methods and found these domains to be intrinsically unstructured. We show that the photolyase-homology region interacts with the C-terminal domain, inducing stable tertiary structure in the C-terminal domain. Importantly, we demonstrate a light-dependent conformational change in the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis Cry1. Collectively, these findings provide the first biochemical evidence for the proposed conformational rearrangement of cryptochromes upon light exposure.},

  abstract = {The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for {$>$}= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep {$>$}\textasciitilde{} 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays {$>>$} 2 keV above their binding energy.},

  abstract = {A microarray-based approach was used to screen a soil metagenome for the presence of blue light (BL) photoreceptor-encoding genes. The microarray carried 149 different 54-mer oligonucleotides, derived from consensus sequences of light, oxygen and voltage (LOV) domain BL photoreceptor genes. Calibration of the microarrays allowed the detection of minimally 50 ng of genomic DNA against a background of 2–5 μg of genomic DNA. Identification of a positive cosmid clone was still possible for an amount of 0.25 ng against a background of 10 μg of labelled DNA clones. The array could readily identify targets carrying 4\% sequence mismatch. Using the LOV microarray, up to 1200 library clones in concentrations of c. 20 ng each with a c. 40 kb insert size could be screened in a single batch. After calibration and reliability controls, the microarray was probed with cosmid-cloned DNA from the thermophilic fraction of a soil sample. From this approach, a novel gene was isolated that encodes a protein consisting of several Per-Arnt-Sim domains, a LOV domain associated to a histidine kinase and a response regulator domain. The novel gene showed highest similarity to a known sequence from Kineococcus radiotolerans SRS30216 (58\% identity for the LOV domain only) and to a gene from Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1 (57\% identity). The gene, designated as ht-met1 (Hamburg Thermophile Metagenome 1), was isolated and fully sequenced (3615 bp). ht-met1 is followed by a second open reading frame encoding a Fe-chelatase, an arrangement quite frequent for BL photoreceptors. The LOV domain region of ht-met1 was subcloned and expressed yielding a fully functional, flavin-containing LOV domain. Irradiation generated the typical LOV photochemistry, with the transient formation of a flavin-protein photoadduct. The dark recovery lifetime was found as τREC = 120 s (20°C) and is among the fastest ones determined so far for bacterial LOV domains.},

  abstract = {In macromolecular crystallography, the rigorous detection of changed states (for example, ligand binding) is difficult unless signal is strong. Ambiguous (‘weak’ or ‘noisy’) density is experimentally common, since molecular states are generally only fractionally present in the crystal. Existing methodologies focus on generating maximally accurate maps whereby minor states become discernible; in practice, such map interpretation is disappointingly subjective, time-consuming and methodologically unsound. Here we report the PanDDA method, which automatically reveals clear electron density for the changed state—even from inaccurate maps—by subtracting a proportion of the confounding ‘ground state’; changed states are objectively identified from statistical analysis of density distributions. The method is completely general, implying new best practice for all changed-state studies, including the routine collection of multiple ground-state crystals. More generally, these results demonstrate: the incompleteness of atomic models; that single data sets contain insufficient information to model them fully; and that accuracy requires further map-deconvolution approaches.},

In its most recent applications, it is the ideal tool to track chemistry as structure evolves in the course of time-resolved experiments, to identify freeze-trapped catalytic intermediates and to assess radiation-induced effects on enzyme crystals. To these goals, instruments have been developed to record optical spectra ‘on-line’ in the course of X-ray data collection, whereas more rigorous polarized absorption studies ‘off-line’ play an essential role in describing what protein function is retained in the crystalline state and correlating it with the observed structures.},

  abstract = {The crystal structure of sensory rhodopsin II from Natronobacterium pharaonis was recently solved at 2.1 Å resolution from lipidic cubic phase-grown crystals. A critical analysis of previous structure–function studies is possible within the framework of the high-resolution structure of this photoreceptor. Based on the structure, a molecular understanding emerges of the efficiency and selectivity of the photoisomerization reaction, of the interaction of the sensory receptor and its cognate transducer protein HtrII, and of the mechanism of spectral tuning in photoreceptors. The architecture of the retinal binding pocket is compact, representing a major determinant for the selective binding of the chromophore, all-trans retinal to the apoprotein, opsin. Several chromophore–protein interactions revealed by the structure were not predicted by previous mutagenesis and spectroscopic analyses. The structure suggests likely mechanisms by which photoisomerization triggers the activation of sensory rhodopsin II, and highlights the possibility of a unified mechanism of signaling mediated by sensory receptors, including visual rhodopsins. Future investigations using time-resolved crystallography, structural dynamics, and computational studies will provide the basis to unveil the molecular mechanisms of sensory receptors-mediated transmembrane signaling.},

In doing so, we implicitly assumed that this is indeed the reality. Now it is time to think about the problem from a different point of view: how atoms or molecules can be observed — either directly or indirectly — and thus, how is it possible to determine the crystal structure of a material and verify the concepts of crystallographic symmetry. To begin answering this question, consider the following mental experiment: imagine yourself in a dark room next to this book. Since human eyes are sensitive to visible light, you will not be able to see the book, nor will you be able to read these words in total darkness (Fig. 6.1, left). Only when you turn on the light, does the book become visible, and the information stored here becomes accessible (Fig. 6.1, right). The fundamental outcome of our experiment is that the book and its content can be observed by means of a visible light after it has been scattered by the object (the book), detected by the eyes.},

  abstract = {Time-Resolved Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (TR-SFX) conducted at X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) has become a powerful tool for capturing macromolecular structural movies of light-initiated processes. As the capabilities of XFELs advance, we anticipate that a new range of coherent control and structural Raman measurements will become achievable. Shorter optical and x-ray pulse durations and increasingly more exotic pulse regimes are becoming available at free electron lasers. Moreover, with high repetition enabled by the superconducting technology of European XFEL (EuXFEL) and Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II) , it will be possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the light-induced differences, allowing for the observation of vibronic motion on the sub-Angstrom level. To predict and assign this coherent motion, which is measurable with a structural technique, new theoretical approaches must be developed. In this paper, we present a theoretical density matrix approach to model the various population and coherent dynamics of a system, which considers molecular system parameters and excitation conditions. We emphasize the use of the Wigner transform of the time-dependent density matrix, which provides a phase space representation that can be directly compared to the experimental positional displacements measured in a TR-SFX experiment. Here, we extend the results from simple models to include more realistic schemes that include large relaxation terms. We explore a variety of pulse schemes using multiple model systems using realistic parameters. An open-source software package is provided to perform the density matrix simulation and Wigner transformations. The open-source software allows us to define any arbitrary level schemes as well as any arbitrary electric field in the interaction Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Fusion proteins containing blue-light-activable protein domains possess great potential as molecular switches in cell signalling. This has recently been impressively demonstrated by connecting the light oxygen voltage LOV2-Jα-protein domain of A. sativa (AsLOV2-Jα) with the Rac1-GTPase, responsible for regulating the morphology and motility of metazoan cells. However, a target-oriented development of fusion proteins in conjunction with this photosensor is still very challenging, because a detailed understanding of its signal transduction pathway on a molecular level is still lacking. Here, we show through molecular dynamics simulation that, after formation of the cysteinyl-flavin mononucleotide (FMN) adduct, the signalling pathway begins with a rotational reorientation of the residue glutamine 1029 adjacent to the FMN chromophore, transmitting stress through the Iβ strand towards the LOV2-Jα interface. This then results in the breakage of two H-bonds, namely, glutamic acid 1034–Gln995 and aspartic acid (Asp) 1056–Gln1013, at opposite sides of the interface between the Jα helix and the LOV2 domain, ultimately leading to a disruption of Jα helix from the LOV2 core.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Algae are photosynthetic eukaryotic (micro-)organisms, lacking roots, leaves, and other organs that are typical for land plants. They live in freshwater, marine, or terrestrial habitats. Together with the cyanobacteria they contribute to about half of global carbon fixation. As primary producers, they are at the basis of many food webs and they are involved in biogeochemical processes. Algae are evolutionarily distinct and are derived either by primary (e.g., green and red algae) or secondary endosymbiosis (e.g., diatoms, dinoflagellates, and brown algae). Light is a key abiotic factor needed to maintain the fitness of algae as it delivers energy for photosynthesis, regulates algal cell- and life cycles, and entrains their biological clocks. However, excess light can also be harmful, especially in the ultraviolet range. Among the variety of receptors perceiving light information, the cryptochromes originally evolved as UV-A and blue-light receptors and have been found in all studied algal genomes so far. Yet, the classification, biophysical properties, wavelength range of absorbance, and biological functions of cryptochromes are remarkably diverse among algal species, especially when compared to cryptochromes from land plants or animals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Among magnetic resonances, site-directed spin labeling coupled to electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (SDSL-EPR) has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the structural properties of biomolecules directly in cells. Since the first in-cell EPR experiment was reported in 2010, substantial progress has been made, and this Review provides a detailed overview of the developments and applications of this spectroscopic technique. The strategies available for preparing a cellular sample and the EPR methods that can be applied to cells will be discussed. The array of spin labels available, along with their strengths and weaknesses in cellular contexts, will also be described. Several examples will illustrate how in-cell EPR can be applied to different biological systems and how the cellular environment affects the structural and dynamic properties of different proteins. Lastly, the Review will focus on the future developments expected to expand the capabilities of this promising technique.},

The major group of NaRs is characterized by an NDQ motif and has two aspartic acid residues in the central region essential for sodium transport. Here we identified a new subgroup of the NDQ rhodopsins bearing an additional glutamic acid residue in the close vicinity to the retinal Schiff base. We thoroughly characterized a member of this subgroup, namely the protein ErNaR from Erythrobacter sp. HL-111 and showed that the additional glutamic acid results in almost complete loss of pH sensitivity for sodium-pumping activity, which is in contrast to previously studied NaRs. ErNaR is capable of transporting sodium efficiently even at acidic pH levels. X-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-electron microscopy reveal that the additional glutamic acid residue mediates the connection between the other two Schiff base counterions and strongly interacts with the aspartic acid of the characteristic NDQ motif. Hence, it reduces its pKa. Our findings shed light on a new subgroup of NaRs and might serve as a basis for their rational optimization for optogenetics.},

  abstract = {pH is an important parameter that affects many functions of live cells, from protein structure or function to several crucial steps of their metabolism. Genetically encoded pH sensors based on pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins have been developed and used to monitor the pH of intracellular compartments. The quantitative analysis of pH variations can be performed either by ratiometric or fluorescence lifetime detection. However, most available genetically encoded pH sensors are based on green and yellow fluorescent proteins and are not compatible with multicolor approaches. Taking advantage of the strong pH sensitivity of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), we demonstrate here its suitability as a sensitive pH sensor using fluorescence lifetime imaging. The intracellular ECFP lifetime undergoes large changes (32~\%) in the pH 5 to pH 7 range, which allows accurate pH measurements to better than 0.2 pH units. By fusion of ECFP with the granular chromogranin A, we successfully measured the pH in secretory granules of PC12 cells, and we performed a kinetic analysis of intragranular pH variations in living cells exposed to ammonium chloride.},

  abstract = {Unlike conductors, insulators do not support large densities of free charge carriers. Instead, exposure to electromagnetic waves induces, in insulators, various polarization processes that are related to the formation of dipoles from bound charges. These polarization processes interact with electromagnetic waves that match their characteristic, or resonance, frequencies. If polarization resonances are outside of the visible wavelength range, and for insulators without grain boundary scattering, then the insulator is transparent. In this chapter, polarization processes in insulators are treated mathematically by applying a simple harmonic oscillator model with a restoring force (Lorentz model). Solutions to the equations of motion of dipoles lead to selection rules for optical transitions involved in absorption and refractive index dispersion. This chapter presents polarization formulae derived from both classical and quantum-mechanical approaches. We show that the propagation of light through insulators involves absorption, refractive index dispersion, reflection, refraction, and scattering. Equations are derived, and examples are presented for various classes of insulators. Finally, refractive index measurement techniques are presented with a description of some widely used instrumentation.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) open the possibility of obtaining diffraction information from a single biological macromolecule. This is because XFELs can generate extremely intense x-ray pulses that are so short that diffraction data can be collected before the sample is destroyed. By collecting a sufficient number of single-particle diffraction patterns, the three-dimensional electron density of a molecule can be reconstructed ab initio. The quality of the reconstruction depends largely on the number of patterns collected at the experiment. This paper provides an estimate of the number of diffraction patterns required to reconstruct the electron density at a targeted spatial resolution. This estimate is verified by simulations for realistic x-ray fluences, repetition rates, and experimental conditions available at modern XFELs. Employing the bacterial phytochrome as a model system, we demonstrate that sub-nanometer resolution is within reach.},

This report describes the cloning and sequencing of both cDNA and genomic clones of GFP from the cnidarian, Aequorea victoria. The gfp10 cDNA encodes a 238-aa-residue polypeptide with a calculated Mr of 26888. Comparsion of A. victoria GFP genomic clones shows three different restriction enzyme patterns which suggests that at least three different genes are present in the A. victoria population at Friday Harbor, Washington. The gfp gene encoded by the λGFP2 genomic clone is comprised of at least three exons spread over 2.6 kb. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and the gene will aid in the elucidation of structure-function relationships in this unique class of proteins.},

X-ray free-electron laser studies including time-resolved crystallography and emission spectroscopy reveal how reaction of IPNS:Fe(II):ACV with dioxygen to yield an Fe(III) superoxide causes differences in active site volume and unexpected conformational changes that propagate to structurally remote regions. Combined with solution studies, the results reveal the importance of protein dynamics in regulating intermediate conformations during conversion of ACV to IPN. The results have implications for catalysis by multiple IPNS-related oxygenases, including those involved in the human hypoxic response, and highlight the power of serial femtosecond crystallography to provide insight into long-range enzyme dynamics during reactions presently impossible for nonprotein catalysts.},

  abstract = {Singular value decomposition (SVD) separates time-dependent crystallographic data into time-independent and time-dependent components. Procedures for the effective application of SVD to time-resolved macromolecular crystallographic data have yet to be explored systematically. Here, the applicability of SVD to experimental crystallographic data is tested by analyzing 30 time-resolved Laue data sets spanning a time range of nanoseconds to milliseconds through the photocycle of the E46Q mutant of photoactive yellow protein. The data contain random and substantial systematic errors, the latter largely arising from crystal-to-crystal variation. The signal-to-noise ratio of weighted difference electron-density maps is significantly improved by the SVD flattening procedure. Application of SVD to these flattened maps spreads the signal across many of the 30 singular vectors, but a rotation of the vectors partitions the large majority of the signal into only five singular vectors. Fitting the time-dependent vectors to a sum of simple exponentials suggests that a chemical kinetic mechanism can describe the time-dependent structural data. Procedures for the effective SVD analysis of experimental time-resolved crystallographic data have been established and emphasize the necessity for minimizing systematic errors by modification of the data-collection protocol.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure of biomacromolecules to ionising radiation results in damage that is initiated by free radicals and progresses through a variety of mechanisms. A widely used technique to study the three-dimensional structures of biomacromolecules is crystallography, which makes use of ionising X-rays. It is crucial to know to what extent structures determined using this technique might be biased by the inherent radiation damage. Results: The consequences of radiation damage have been investigated for three dissimilar proteins. Similar results were obtained for each protein, atomic B factors increase, unit-cell volumes increase, protein molecules undergo slight rotations and translations, disulphide bonds break and decarboxylation of acidic residues occurs. All of these effects introduce non-isomorphism. The absorbed dose in these experiments can be reached during routine data collection at undulator beamlines of third generation synchrotron sources. Conclusions: X-rays can leave a ‘fingerprint’ on structures, even at cryogenic temperatures. Serious non-isomorphism can be introduced, thus hampering multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing methods. Specific structural changes can occur before the traditional measures of radiation damage have signalled it. Care must be taken when assigning structural significance to features that might easily be radiation-damage-induced changes. It is proposed that the electron-affinic disulphide bond traps electrons that migrate over the backbone of the protein, and that the sidechains of glutamic acid and aspartic acid donate electrons to nearby electron holes and become decarboxylated successively. The different disulphide bonds in each protein show a clear order of susceptibility, which might well relate to their intrinsic stability.},

  abstract = {Iron is the quantitatively most important trace metal involved in thylakoid reactions of all oxygenic organisms since linear (= non-cyclic) electron flow from H2O to NADP+ involves PS II (2–3 Fe), cytochrome b6-f (5 Fe), PS I (12 Fe), and ferredoxin (2 Fe); (replaceable by metal-free flavodoxin in certain cyanobacteria and algae under iron deficiency). Cytochrome c6 (1 Fe) is the only redox catalyst linking the cytochrome b6-f complex to PS I in most algae; in many cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta cytochrome c6 and the copper-containing plastocyanin are alternatives, with the availability of iron and copper regulating their relative expression, while higher plants only have plastocyanin. Iron, copper and zinc occur in enzymes that remove active oxygen species and that are in part bound to the thylakoid membrane. These enzymes are ascorbate peroxidase (Fe) and iron-(cyanobacteria, and most al gae) and copper-zinc- (some algae; higher plants) superoxide dismutase. Iron-containing NAD(P)H-PQ oxidoreductase in thylakoids of cyanobacteria and many eukaryotes may be involved in cyclic electron transport around PS I and in chlororespiration. Manganese is second to iron in its quantitative role in the thylakoids, with four Mn (and 1 Ca) per PS II involved in O2 evolution. The roles of the transition metals in redox catalysts can in broad terms be related to their redox chemistry and to their availability to organisms at the time when the pathways evolved. The quantitative roles of these trace metals varies genotypically (e.g. the greater need for iron in thylakoid reactions of cyanobacteria and rhodophytes than in other O2-evolvers as a result of their lower PS II:PS I ratio) and phenotypically (e.g. as a result of variations in PS II:PS I ratio with the spectral quality of incident radiation).},

  abstract = {A renewed interest in the Laue diffraction technique has been brought about by the development of new, more intense and brilliant synchrotron sources along with their insertion devices such as wigglers and undulators, and by the prospect of using these sources to study structural dynamics by time-resolved crystallography. Theoretical studies during the past decade have identified unique features of the polychromatic diffraction geometry and greatly improved our understanding of the Laue method. This led to innovative approaches to Laue data processing and its software implementation. Most of the problems in Laue data processing, considered for a long time to limit the applicability of the technique, have been solved. Significant advances have also been made in the development of synchrotron sources, beamline optics and instrumentation, and the X-ray detectors. Static Laue experiments yield structure amplitudes that equal those from monochromatic data in quality. When coupled with careful consideration of data-collection strategies and reaction initiation in crystals, a series of successful time-resolved Laue experiments on biological systems have been conducted. These have revealed information on structural dynamics inaccessible to any other conventional diffraction method. These static and time-resolved experiments demonstrate that the Laue method is coming of age. They also suggest avenues for future improvements: a correct treatment of finite mosaic spread and the associated energy width of Laue spots; consideration of diffuse scattering; and determination of intermediate structures in time-resolved experiments in which those intermediates do not attain a high concentration.},

The step critical to entry into the photocycle is identified as flipping of the carbonyl group of the 4-hydroxycinnamic acid chromophore into an adjacent, hydrophobic environment rather than the concomitant isomerization about the double bond of the chromophore tail. The structural perturbation generated at the chromophore propagates throughout the entire protein as a light-induced “protein quake” with its “epicenter” at the carbonyl moiety of the chromophore.},

  abstract = {The reduction of X-ray diffraction data obtained by the Laue method to accurate integrated intensities is more complicated and much less familiar than the reduction of monochromatic data. Problems of data accuracy and completeness have hindered the wide use of the Laue technique in macromolecular crystallography. Its unique advantage, data-collection speed, has been exploited only in situations such as fast time-resolved crystallography, to which monochromatic techniques are not as well suited. This paper reviews the major problems in data reduction in the Laue technique and provides a unified solution to the problems in integration of both streaky and spatially overlapping spots and data scaling. This solution has been incorporated into a new Laue diffraction datareduction software package, LaueView. Laue data sets from crystals of lysozyme and \textasciitilde -haemolysin have been processed to test this solution, and demonstrate that Laue data sets can be reduced to yield structure amplitudes of at the very least the same quality as the best monochromatic data sets in terms of both accuracy and completeness.},

There are two competing hypotheses for the primary process underlying the avian magnetic compass, one involving magnetite3,4,5, the other a magnetically sensitive chemical reaction6,7,8. Here we show that oscillating magnetic fields disrupt the magnetic orientation behaviour of migratory birds. Robins were disoriented when exposed to a vertically aligned broadband (0.1–10\,MHz) or a single-frequency (7-MHz) field in addition to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, in the 7-MHz oscillating field, this effect depended on the angle between the oscillating and the geomagnetic fields. The birds exhibited seasonally appropriate migratory orientation when the oscillating field was parallel to the geomagnetic field, but were disoriented when it was presented at a 24° or 48° angle. These results are consistent with a resonance effect on singlet–triplet transitions and suggest a magnetic compass based on a radical-pair mechanism7,8.},

  abstract = {Studying the interaction between ligands and proteins is an important step in the Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) process. The most widely used method for these studies is X-ray crystallography. However, depending on the specific characteristics of the system being studied, some ligands may not fully penetrate into the large macromolecular crystals that are typically used for these studies. Microcrystals offer the possibility of more complete soaking of ligands, but have several technical challenges. The first is that until recently, access to instrumentation for routine microcrystallography has been limited. Such experiments require highly focused and intense X-ray beams that match the size of protein crystals, as well as extremely high precision goniometry to ensure that the sample stays centered in the beam. Additionally, radiation damage generally prevents the collection of full datasets from individual crystals. This means that a serial approach must be employed in which data from multiple crystals are combined. In many cases this is a trivial task, but in some cases, these microcrystals can exhibit non-isomorphism, possibly due to natural variations or binding of heavy atoms or compound(s). We used techniques to deal with non isomorphism such as a genetic algorithm (CODGAS) or hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to segregate serial crystallographic data in order to improve the electron density of bound ligands. Protocols were developed and tested both on experimental and simulated data. In both cases, we observed improvements in the ligand's electron density amongst the separated groups, compared to merging all sub datasets. This improvement could facilitate the modelling of protein-ligand interactions, which could in turn facilitate the drug discovery process.},

Most commonly, the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) is used as the donor fluorophore, coupled with one of several yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) variants as the acceptor. ECFP is used despite several spectroscopic disadvantages, namely a low quantum yield, a low extinction coefficient and a fluorescence lifetime that is best fit by a double exponential. To improve the characteristics of ECFP for FRET measurements, we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to overcome these disadvantages. The resulting variant, which we named Cerulean (ECFP/S72A/Y145A/H148D), has a greatly improved quantum yield, a higher extinction coefficient and a fluorescence lifetime that is best fit by a single exponential. Cerulean is 2.5-fold brighter than ECFP and replacement of ECFP with Cerulean substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio of a FRET-based sensor for glucokinase activation.},

It numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans2,3, and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis. Here we compare the genomes of two Prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the Prochlorococcus lineage4 and that have different minimum, maximum and optimal light intensities for growth5. The high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 base pairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger, at 2,410,873 base pairs (2,275 genes). The comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures. Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer. Some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables, and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans.},

  abstract = {Migratory birds travel vast distances each year, finding their way by various means, including a remarkable ability to perceive the Earth's magnetic field. Although it has been known for 40 years that birds possess a magnetic compass, avian magnetoreception is poorly understood at all levels from the primary biophysical detection events, signal transduction pathways and neurophysiology, to the processing of information in the brain. It has been proposed that the primary detector is a specialized ocular photoreceptor that plays host to magnetically sensitive photochemical reactions having radical pairs as fleeting intermediates. Here, we present a physical chemist's perspective on the “radical pair mechanism” of compass magnetoreception in birds. We outline the essential chemical requirements for detecting the direction of an Earth-strength ≈50 μT magnetic field and comment on the likelihood that these might be satisfied in a biologically plausible receptor. Our survey concludes with a discussion of cryptochrome, the photoactive protein that has been put forward as the magnetoreceptor molecule.},

  abstract = {Rhodopsin is a G-protein-coupled receptor that detects light and initiates the intracellular signalling cascades that underpin vertebrate vision. Light sensitivity is achieved by covalent linkage to 11-cis retinal, which isomerizes upon photo-absorption. Serial femtosecond crystallography data collected from rhodopsin microcrystals grown in the lipidic cubic phase were used to solve the room-temperature structure of the receptor. Although the diffraction data showed high completeness and good consistency to 1.8 Å resolution, prominent electron-density features remained unaccounted for throughout the unit cell after model building and refinement. A deeper analysis of the diffraction intensities uncovered the presence of a lattice-translocation defect (LTD) within the crystals. The procedure followed to correct the diffraction intensities for this pathology enabled the building of an improved resting-state model. The correction was essential to both confidently model the structure of the unilluminated state and interpret the light-activated data collected after photo-excitation of the crystals. It is expected that similar cases of LTD will be observed in other serial crystallography experiments and that correction will be required in a variety of systems.},

With crystal lifetimes typically in the millisecond range and the latest-generation detector technologies with high framing rates up to 1\>kHz, fast sample exchange has become the bottleneck for such experiments. A micro-patterned chip has been developed from single-crystalline silicon, which acts as a sample holder for up to several thousand microcrystals at a very low background level. The crystals can be easily loaded onto the chip and excess mother liquor can be efficiently removed. Dehydration of the crystals is prevented by keeping them in a stream of humidified air during data collection. Further sealing of the sample holder, for example with Kapton, is not required. Room-temperature data collection from insulin crystals loaded onto the chip proves the applicability of the chip for macromolecular crystallography. Subsequent structure refinements reveal no radiation-damage-induced structural changes for insulin crystals up to a dose of 565.6\>kGy, even though the total diffraction power of the crystals has on average decreased to 19.1\% of its initial value for the same dose. A decay of the diffracting power by half is observed for a dose of               D               1/2               = 147.5\>±\>19.1\>kGy, which is about 1/300 of the dose before crystals show a similar decay at cryogenic temperatures.},

In contrast, for liquids or solids at low temperatures, any lateral Rayleigh scattering can be suppressed significantly.

We use simple exactly solvable models to show that the suppression of Rayleigh scattering is proportional to the ratio of the interparticle correlation length to the interparticle distance. The wavelength of the scattered radiation is much larger than both these quantities in many cases of interest and does not play an explicit role in the suppression of lateral Rayleigh scattering.},

A direct comparison of the two structures provides insight into the light-activated signaling mechanism. Major structural differences involve a\textasciitilde 11Å movement of the C terminus in helix Jα, \textasciitilde 4Å movement of Hβ–Iβ loop, disruption of hydrogen bonds in the dimer interface, and a\textasciitilde 29° rotation of chain-B relative to chain-A as compared to the light-state dimer. Both crystal structures and solution NMR data are suggestive of the key roles of a conserved glutamine Q116 and the N-cap region consisting of A′α–Aβ loop and the A′α helix in controlling the light-activated conformational changes.

  abstract = {Many enzymes utilize redox-coupled centers for performing catalysis where these centers are used to control and regulate the transfer of electrons required for catalysis, whose untimely delivery can lead to a state incapable of binding the substrate, i.e., a dead-end enzyme. Copper nitrite reductases (CuNiRs), which catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), have proven to be a good model system for studying these complex processes including proton-coupled electron transfer (ET) and their orchestration for substrate binding/utilization. Recently, a two-domain CuNiR from a Rhizobia species (Br2DNiR) has been discovered with a substantially lower enzymatic activity where the catalytic type-2 Cu (T2Cu) site is occupied by two water molecules requiring their displacement for the substrate nitrite to bind. Single crystal spectroscopy combined with MSOX (multiple structures from one crystal) for both the as-isolated and nitrite-soaked crystals clearly demonstrate that inter-Cu ET within the coupled T1Cu-T2Cu redox system is heavily gated. Laser-flash photolysis and optical spectroscopy showed rapid ET from photoexcited NADH to the T1Cu center but little or no inter-Cu ET in the absence of nitrite. Furthermore, incomplete reoxidation of the T1Cu site (∼20\% electrons transferred) was observed in the presence of nitrite, consistent with a slow formation of NO species in the serial structures of the MSOX movie obtained from the nitrite-soaked crystal, which is likely to be responsible for the lower activity of this CuNiR. Our approach is of direct relevance for studying redox reactions in a wide range of biological systems including metalloproteins that make up at least 30\% of all proteins.},

  abstract = {Copper nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) exhibit a strong pH dependence of their catalytic activity. Structural movies can be obtained by serially recording multiple structures (frames) from the same spot of a crystal using the MSOX serial crystallography approach. This method has been combined with on-line single crystal optical spectroscopy to capture the pH-dependent structural changes that accompany during turnover of CuNiRs from two Rhizobia species. The structural movies, initiated by the redox activation of a type-1 copper site (T1Cu) via X-ray generated photoelectrons, have been obtained for the substrate-free and substrate-bound states at low (high enzymatic activity) and high (low enzymatic activity) pH. At low pH, formation of the product nitric oxide (NO) is complete at the catalytic type-2 copper site (T2Cu) after a dose of 3 MGy (frame 5) with full bleaching of the T1Cu ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) 455~nm band (S(σ)Cys~→~T1Cu2+) which in itself indicates the electronic route of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from T1Cu to T2Cu. In contrast at high pH, the changes in optical spectra are relatively small and the formation of NO is only observed in later frames (frame 15 in Br2DNiR, 10 MGy), consistent with the loss of PCET required for catalysis. This is accompanied by decarboxylation of the catalytic AspCAT residue, with CO2 trapped in the catalytic pocket.},

Advanced synchrotron radiation and x-ray free-electron laser are used to obtain the most accurate (atomic resolution with unrestrained SHELX refinement) and damage-free (free from radiation-induced chemistry) structures, in as-isolated, substrate-bound, and product-bound states. This combination has shed light on the protonation states of essential catalytic residues, additional reaction intermediates, and how catalytic efficiency is modulated.},

These methods are certain to be more widely practiced as macromolecular crystallography evolves from being a form of atomic-level wildlife photography to a bona fide science in which specimens are modified and characterized to test structural or biochemical hypotheses. The sensitivity of isomorphous differences to subtle structural changes and their relative insensitivity to the phase set chosen for imaging make difference maps based on the method of choice for many of the structural studies carried out subsequent to initial structure determinations. One of the great strengths of isomorphous difference Fourier maps is their insensitivity to model bias.},

  abstract = {Synchrotrons are now producing thousands of macromolecular structures each year. The need for complementary techniques available on site has progressively emerged, either to assess the relevance of the structure of a protein or to monitor changes that may occur during X-ray diffraction data collection. Microspectrophotometers in the UV–visible absorbance or fluorescence mode have evolved over the past few decades to become the instruments of choice to perform such tests. Described here are recent improvements to the microspectrophotometer of the so-called Cryobench laboratory located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Optical and mechanical properties have been enhanced so as to record better spectra on smaller samples. A device has been implemented to measure the signal decay of fluorescent samples, either in the crystalline or in the solution state. Recording of the fluorescence lifetime in addition to the steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum allows precise monitoring of the fluorescent sample under study. The device consists of an adaptation of a commercially available time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system. A method to record and analyze series of TCSPC histograms,               e.g.               collected as a function of temperature, is described. To validate the instruments, fluorescence lifetimes of fluorescent small molecules or proteins in the crystalline or solution state, at room and cryo temperatures, have been measured. Lifetimes of a number of fluorescent proteins of the GFP family were generally found to be shorter in crystals than in solution, and slightly longer at cryo temperatures than at ambient temperature. The possibility of performing fluorescence lifetime measurements on crystals at synchrotron facilities widens the variety of spectroscopic techniques complementing X-ray diffraction on macromolecular crystallography beamlines.},

Various approaches are combined to detect and determine accurately the twinning ratio. For each protein, three data sets from crystals exhibiting twinning ratios ranging from 0 to almost 50\% are analysed. Self-rotation functions and Rsym values considering space groups of higher symmetry are indicative of twinning. Precise values of the twinning ratios are derived from Yeates' statistical approaches and Britton plots. The twinning ratios are also obtained by analysing the second-, third- and fourth-order moments of the intensity distribution. The twinning ratios obtained from the various approaches are compared. Second-, third- and fourth-order moments of the intensity distribution are useful indicators for evaluating the twinning precisely in order to correct the intensities or to screen rapidly for non-twinned crystals.},

Bacteriorhodopsin, the simplest known proton pump1, provides a paradigm for understanding this process. Here we report, at 2.1\,Å resolution, the structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin immediately preceding the primary proton transfer event in its photocycle. The early structural rearrangements2 propagate from the protein's core towards the extracellular surface, disrupting the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that stabilizes helix C in the ground state. Concomitantly, a bend of this helix enables the negatively charged3 primary proton acceptor, Asp\,85, to approach closer to the positively charged primary proton donor, the Schiff base. The primary proton transfer event would then neutralize these two groups, cancelling their electrostatic attraction and facilitating a relaxation of helix C to a less strained geometry. Reprotonation of the Schiff base by Asp\,85 would thereby be impeded, ensuring vectorial proton transport. Structural rearrangements also occur near the protein's surface, aiding proton release to the extracellular medium.},

EGFP is extensively used in cell biology and biochemistry as a colocalization or expression reporter. Surprisingly, the structure of this very popular protein has not been determined yet. We report here its crystallographic structure at 1.5Å resolution which shows significant differences in the vicinity of residue 64 and of the chromophore. In particular, two conformations are observed for the key residue glutamic acid 222, in apparent contradiction with the single fluorescence lifetime of the protein. We then show that X-ray induced decarboxylation of Glu222 during diffraction data collection results in the disruption of a hydrogen-bond network near the chromophore. Using single-crystal microspectrophotometry, we demonstrate that this correlates with a significant loss of the fluorescence properties. We thus propose a mechanism of bleaching of the protein at low temperature. Taken together, these two sets of results highlight the stabilizing role of Glu222 to the chromophore cavity of EGFP.},

  abstract = {Sensory rhodopsins (SRs) belong to a subfamily of heptahelical transmembrane proteins containing a retinal chromophore. These photoreceptors mediate the cascade of vision in animal eyes and phototaxis in archaebacteria and unicellular flagellated algae. Signal transduction by these photoreceptors occurs by means of transducer proteins. The two archaebacterial sensory rhodopsins SRI and SRII are coupled to the membrane-bound HtrI and HtrII transducer proteins. Activation of these proteins initiates phosphorylation cascades that modulate the flagellar motors, resulting in either attractant (SRI) or repellent (SRII) phototaxis. In addition, transducer-free SRI and SRII were shown to operate as proton pumps, analogous to bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we present the x-ray structure of SRII from Natronobacterium pharaonis (pSRII) at 2.1-Å resolution, revealing a unique molecular architecture of the retinal-binding pocket. In particular, the structure of pSRII exhibits a largely unbent conformation of the retinal (as compared with bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin), a hydroxyl group of Thr-204 in the vicinity of the Schiff base, and an outward orientation of the guanidinium group of Arg-72. Furthermore, the structure reveals a putative chloride ion that is coupled to the Schiff base by means of a hydrogen-bond network and a unique, positively charged surface patch for a probable interaction with HtrII. The high-resolution structure of pSRII provides a structural basis to elucidate the mechanisms of phototransduction and color tuning.},

However, the data analysis strategy and the postulation of a physically valid model for this kind of measurements may be tackled with many different approaches ranging from pure soft-modeling (model-free) to hard-modeling, where the elaboration of a parametric spectro-temporal model may be required. This paper reviews methods that are used in practice for the analysis of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy data. Model-based methods, common in photochemistry, are revisited, and soft-modeling methods, which originate from the chemometrics field and that recently disseminated in the photo(bio)chemistry literature, are presented. These soft-modeling methods are designed to suit the intrinsic nature of the multivariate (or multi-way) measurement. Soft-modeling tools do not require a priori physical or mechanistic models to provide a decomposition of the data on the time and wavelength dimensions, the only requirement being that these two (or more) dimensions are separable. Additionally, Bayesian data analysis, which provides a probabilistic framework for data analysis, is considered in detail, since it allows uncertainty quantification and validation of the model selection step.},

  abstract = {Protein crystallography data collection at synchrotrons is routinely carried out at cryogenic temperatures to mitigate radiation damage. Although damage still takes place at 100\>K and below, the immobilization of free radicals increases the lifetime of the crystals by approximately 100-fold. Recent studies have shown that flash-cooling decreases the heterogeneity of the conformational ensemble and can hide important functional mechanisms from observation. These discoveries have motivated increasing numbers of experiments to be carried out at room temperature. However, the trade-offs between increased risk of radiation damage and increased observation of alternative conformations at room temperature relative to cryogenic temperature have not been examined. A considerable amount of effort has previously been spent studying radiation damage at cryo-temperatures, but the relevance of these studies to room temperature diffraction is not well understood. Here, the effects of radiation damage on the conformational landscapes of three different proteins (T. danielli thaumatin, hen egg-white lysozyme and human cyclophilin A) at room (278\>K) and cryogenic (100\>K) temperatures are investigated. Increasingly damaged datasets were collected at each temperature, up to a maximum dose of the order of 107\>Gy at 100\>K and 105\>Gy at 278\>K. Although it was not possible to discern a clear trend between damage and multiple conformations at either temperature, it was observed that disorder, monitored by B-factor-dependent crystallographic order parameters, increased with higher absorbed dose for the three proteins at 100\>K. At 278\>K, however, the total increase in this disorder was only statistically significant for thaumatin. A correlation between specific radiation damage affecting side chains and the amount of disorder was not observed. This analysis suggests that elevated conformational heterogeneity in crystal structures at room temperature is observed despite radiation damage, and not as a result thereof.},

  abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is an unusually stable fluorescent protein that belongs to a family of related auto-fluorescent proteins (AFPs). These AFPs have been generated from jellyfish GFP by mutating the amino acids in the chromophore or its vicinity. Variants that emit light in the blue region (Blue Fluorescent Protein, BFP), red region, or yellow region are readily available and are widely used in diverse applications. Previously, we had used fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effect of pH on the denaturation of GFP with SDS, urea, and heat. Surprisingly, we found that SDS, urea or heat, did not have any significant effect on the fluorescence of GFP at pH 7.5 or 8.5, however, at pH 6.5, the protein lost all fluorescence within a very short period of time. These results suggested that GFP undergoes a structural/stability shift between pH 6.5 and 7.5, with the GFP structure at pH 6.5 being very sensitive to denaturation by SDS, urea, and heat. In the present study, we wanted to explore whether the stability or structure of the closely related BFP is also pH dependent. As expected, we found heat-induced denaturation and renaturation of BFP to be pH dependent, very much like GFP. However, when exposed to other denaturants like urea/heat or SDS we found BFP to behave very differently than GFP. Unlike GFP, which at pH 8.5 and 7.5 is very resistant to SDS-induced denaturation, BFP readily lost about 20\% of its fluorescence at pH 8.5 and about 60\% fluorescence at pH 7.5. Also, our denaturation and renaturation studies show that under certain conditions, BFP is more stable than GFP, such that under conditions where GFP is completely denatured, BFP still retained significant fluorescence. Taken together, our preliminary results show that despite being very similar in both amino acid sequences and overall structures, there may be subtle and important structural/conformational differences between BFP and GFP.},

Herein, a novel absorption spectrometer was developed at SPring-8 BL26B2 with a nearly on-axis geometry between the X-ray and optical axes. A small prism mirror was placed near the X-ray beamstop to pass the light only 2° off the X-ray beam, enabling spectroscopic analysis of the X-ray-exposed volume of a crystal during X-ray diffraction data collection. The spectrometer was applied to NO reductase, a heme enzyme that catalyzes NO reduction to N               2               O. Radiation damage to the heme was monitored in real time during X-ray irradiation by evaluating the absorption spectral changes. Moreover, NO binding to the heme was probed               via               caged NO photolysis with UV light, demonstrating the extended capability of the spectrometer for intermediate analysis.},

  abstract = {UV-A/blue light acts to regulate a number of physiological processes in higher plants. These include light-driven chloroplast movement and phototropism. The NPH1 gene of Arabidopsis encodes an autophosphorylating protein kinase that functions as a photoreceptor for phototropism in response to low-intensity blue light. However, nph1 mutants have been reported to exhibit normal phototropic curvature under high-intensity blue light, indicating the presence of an additional phototropic receptor. A likely candidate is the nph1 homologue, npl1, which has recently been shown to mediate the avoidance response of chloroplasts to high-intensity blue light in Arabidopsis. Here we demonstrate that npl1, like nph1, noncovalently binds the chromophore flavin mononucleotide (FMN) within two specialized PAS domains, termed LOV domains. Furthermore, when expressed in insect cells, npl1, like nph1, undergoes light-dependent autophosphorylation, indicating that npl1 also functions as a light receptor kinase. Consistent with this conclusion, we show that a nph1npl1 double mutant exhibits an impaired phototropic response under both low- and high-intensity blue light. Hence, npl1 functions as a second phototropic receptor under high fluence rate conditions and is, in part, functionally redundant to nph1. We also demonstrate that both chloroplast accumulation in response to low-intensity light and chloroplast avoidance movement in response to high-intensity light are lacking in the nph1npl1 double mutant. Our findings therefore indicate that nph1 and npl1 show partially overlapping functions in two different responses, phototropism and chloroplast relocation, in a fluence rate-dependent manner.},

  abstract = {The plant photoreceptor phototropin is an autophosphorylating serine-threonine protein kinase activated by UV-A/blue light. Two domains, LOV1 and LOV2, members of the PAS domain superfamily, mediate light sensing by phototropin. Heterologous expression studies have shown that both domains function as FMN-binding sites. Although three plant blue light photoreceptors, cry1, cry2, and phototropin, have been identified to date, the photochemical reactions underlying photoactivation of these light sensors have not been described so far. Herein, we demonstrate that the LOV domains of Avena sativa phototropin undergo a self-contained photocycle characterized by a loss of blue light absorbance in response to light and a spontaneous recovery of the blue light-absorbing form in the dark. Rate constants and quantum efficiencies for the photoreactions indicate that LOV1 exhibits a lower photosensitivity than LOV2. The spectral properties of the photoproduct produced for both LOV domains are unrelated to those found for photoreduced flavins and flavoproteins, but are consistent with those of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct. Flavin-thiol adducts are generally short-lifetime reaction intermediates formed during the flavoprotein-catalyzed reduction of protein disulfides. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified several amino acid residues within the putative chromophore binding site of LOV1 and LOV2 that appear to be important for FMN binding and/or the photochemical reactivity. Among those is Cys39, which plays an important role in the photochemical reaction of the LOV domains. Replacement of Cys39 with Ala abolished the photochemical reactions of both LOV domains. We therefore propose that light sensing by the phototropin LOV domains occurs via the formation of a stable adduct between the FMN chromophore and Cys39.},

In addition several of the genes encoding these enzymes have now been cloned and sequenced. These studies have revealed remarkable functional and structural conservation among these evolutionarily ancient enzymes and have identified a new role for photolyases in dark-repair processes which has implications for the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

The light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin is the best-characterized protein providing this function. Photon energy is absorbed by the chromophore retinal, covalently bound to Lys\,216 via a protonated Schiff base. The light-induced all-trans to 13-cis isomerization of the retinal results in deprotonation of the Schiff base followed by alterations in protonatable groups within bacteriorhodopsin. The changed force field induces changes, even in the tertiary structure1,2,3, which are necessary for proton pumping. The recent report4 of a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure for the late M intermediate of a mutant bacteriorhopsin (with Asp 96→Asn) displays the structure of a proton pathway highly disturbed by the mutation. To observe an unperturbed proton pathway, we determined the structure of the late M intermediate of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin (2.25\,Å resolution). The cytoplasmic side of our M2 structure shows a water net that allows proton transfer from the proton donor group Asp\,96 towards the Schiff base. An enlarged cavity system above Asp\,96 is observed, which facilitates the de- and reprotonation of this group by fluctuating water molecules in the last part of the cycle.},

  abstract = {It has long been known that toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are stored in the bacterial cells in crystalline form. Here we describe the structure determination of the Cry3A toxin found naturally crystallized within Bt cells. When whole Bt cells were streamed into an X-ray free-electron laser beam we found that scattering from other cell components did not obscure diffraction from the crystals. The resolution limits of the best diffraction images collected from cells were the same as from isolated crystals. The integrity of the cells at the moment of diffraction is unclear; however, given the short time (∼5 µs) between exiting the injector to intersecting with the X-ray beam, our result is a 2.9-Å-resolution structure of a crystalline protein as it exists in a living cell. The study suggests that authentic in vivo diffraction studies can produce atomic-level structural information.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of proton transfer in Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) have been studied as a model system for characterizing the correlation between dynamics and function of proteins in general. The kinetics in EGFP (a variant of GFP) were monitored by using a laser-induced pH jump method. The pH was jumped from 8 to 5 by nanosecond flash photolysis of the “caged proton,” o-nitrobenzaldehyde, and subsequent proton transfer was monitored by following the decrease in fluorescence intensity. The modulation of proton transfer kinetics by external perturbants such as viscosity, pH, and subdenaturing concentrations of GdnHCl as well as of salts was studied. The rate of proton transfer was inversely proportional to solvent viscosity, suggesting that the rate-limiting step is the transfer of protons through the protein matrix. The rate is accelerated at lower pH values, and measurements of the fluorescence properties of tryptophan 57 suggest that the enhancement in rate is associated with an enhancement in protein dynamics. The rate of proton transfer is nearly independent of temperature, unlike the rate of the reverse process. When the stability of the protein was either decreased or increased by the addition of co-solutes, including the salts KCl, KNO3, and K2SO4, a significant decrease in the rate of proton transfer was observed in all cases. The lack of correlation between the rate of proton transfer and the stability of the protein suggests that the structure is tuned to ensure maximum efficiency of the dynamics that control the proton transfer function of the protein.},

  abstract = {Absorption, fluorescence and excitation spectra of three-dimensional bacteriorhodopsin crystals harvested from a lipidic cubic phase are presented. The combination of the spectroscopic experiments performed at room temperature, controlled pH and full external hydration reveals the presence of three distinct protein species. Besides the well-known form observed in purple membrane, we find two other species with a relative contribution of up to 30\%. As the spectra are similar to those of dehydrated or deionized membranes containing bacteriorhodopsin, we suggest that amino acid residues, located in the vicinity of the retinal chromophore, have changed their protonation state. We propose partial dehydration during crystallization and/or room temperature conditions as the main source of this heterogeneity. This assignment is supported by an experiment showing interconversion of the species upon intentional dehydration and by crystallographic data, which have indicated an in-plane unit cell in 3D crystals comparable to that of dehydrated bacteriorhodopsin membranes. Full hydration of the proteins after the water-withdrawing crystallization process is hampered. We suggest that this hindered water diffusion originates mainly from a closure of hydrophobic crystal surfaces by lipid bilayers. The present spectroscopic work complements the crystallographic data, due to its ability to determine quantitatively compositional heterogeneity resulting from proteins in different protonation states.},

The Trp absorption decreases within the first 200 femtoseconds and then recovers on time scales typical for retinal isomerization and vibrational relaxation. A model of excitonic coupling between retinal and tryptophans shows that the signal reflects a gradual rise of the retinal difference dipole moment, which precedes and probably drives isomerization. The results suggest an intimate connection between the progressive dipole moment change and the retinal skeletal changes reported over the same time scale.},

Blue light excitation of the enzyme generates the neutral FAD radical, FADH·, which is believed to be transiently formed during the enzymatic DNA repair. Here (6-4) photolyase has been examined by optical spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and pulsed electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy. Characterization of selected proton hyperfine couplings of FADH·, namely those of H8α and H1′, yields information on the micropolarity at the site where the DNA substrate is expected to bind. Shifts in the hyperfine couplings as a function of structural modifications induced by point mutations and pH changes distinguish the protonation states of two highly conserved histidines, His354 and His358, in Xenopus laevis (6-4) photolyase. These are proposed to catalyze formation of the oxetane intermediate that precedes light-initiated DNA repair. The results show that at pH 9.5, where the enzymatic repair activity is highest, His358 is deprotonated, whereas His354 is protonated. Hence, the latter is likely the proton donor that initiates oxetane formation from the (6-4) photoproduct.},

  abstract = {Protein crystallography using synchrotron radiation sources has had a tremendous impact on biology, having yielded the structures of thousands of proteins and given detailed insight into their mechanisms. However, the technique is limited by the requirement for macroscopic crystals, which can be difficult to obtain, as well as by the often severe radiation damage caused in diffraction experiments, in particular when using tiny crystals. To slow radiation damage, data collection is typically performed at cryogenic temperatures. With the advent of free-electron lasers (FELs) capable of delivering extremely intense femtosecond X-ray pulses, this situation appears to be remedied, allowing the structure determination of undamaged macromolecules using either macroscopic or microscopic crystals. The latter are exposed to the FEL beam in random orientations and their diffraction data are collected at cryogenic or room temperature in a serial fashion, since each crystal is destroyed upon a single exposure. The new approaches required for crystal growth and delivery, and for diffraction data analysis, including               de novo               phasing, are reviewed. The opportunities and challenges of SFX are described, including applications such as time-resolved measurements and the analysis of radiation damage-prone systems.},

  abstract = {Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a technique commonly used in the analysis of spectroscopic data that both acts as a noise filter and reduces the dimensionality of subsequent least-squares fits. To establish the applicability of SVD to crystallographic data, we applied SVD to calculated difference Fourier maps simulating those to be obtained in a time-resolved crystallographic study of photoactive yellow protein. The atomic structures of one dark state and three intermediates were used in qualitatively different kinetic mechanisms to generate time-dependent difference maps at specific time points. Random noise of varying levels in the difference structure factor amplitudes, different extents of reaction initiation, and different numbers of time points were all employed to simulate a range of realistic experimental conditions. Our results show that SVD allows for an unbiased differentiation between signal and noise; a small subset of singular values and vectors represents the signal well, reducing the random noise in the data. Due to this, phase information of the difference structure factors can be obtained. After identifying and fitting a kinetic mechanism, the time-independent structures of the intermediates could be recovered. This demonstrates that SVD will be a powerful tool in the analysis of experimental time-resolved crystallographic data.},

D 69, 2534–2542 (2013)], from which barriers of activation can be extracted. With the advent of fourth generation X-ray sources, new opportunities emerge to investigate structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules in real time [M. Schmidt, Adv. Condens.

Kinetic data from time-resolved experiments on short time-scales must be interpreted in terms of chemical kinetics [Steinfeld et al., Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics, 2nd ed. (Prentience Hall, 1985)] and tied to existing time-resolved experiments on longer time-scales [Schmidt et al., Acta Crystallogr. D 69, 2534–2542 (2013); Jung et al., Nat. Chem. 5, 212–220 (2013)]. With this article, we will review and outline steps that are required to routinely determine the energetics of reactions in biomolecules in crystal and solution with newest X-ray sources. In eight sections, we aim to describe concepts and experimental details that may help to inspire new approaches to collect and interpret these data.},

To start a reaction in an enzyme, typically, an initially inactive substrate present in the crystal is activated. This has particular disadvantages that are circumvented when active substrate is directly provided by diffusion. However, then it is prohibitive to use macroscopic crystals because diffusion times become too long. With small micro- and nanocrystals diffusion times are adequately short for most enzymes and the reaction can be swiftly initiated. We demonstrate here that a time-resolved crystallographic experiment becomes feasible by mixing substrate with enzyme nanocrystals which are subsequently injected into the X-ray beam of a pulsed X-ray source.},

The successful fit of exponentials to right singular vectors derived from a singular value decomposition of the difference maps demonstrates that a chemical kinetic mechanism holds and that structurally distinct intermediates exist. We identify two time-independent difference maps, from which we refine the structures of the corresponding intermediates. We thus demonstrate how structures associated with intermediate states can be extracted from the experimental, time-dependent crystallographic data. Stoichiometric and structural constraints allow the exclusion of one kinetic mechanism proposed for the photocycle but retain other plausible candidate kinetic mechanisms.},

There has been an overwhelmingly large body of publications that report the X-ray structures of enzymes determined after substrate and ligand binding. None of them truly show the structures of an enzyme working freely through a sequence of events that range from the formation of the enzyme–substrate complex to the dissociation of the product. The technical difficulties were too severe. By 1969, Sluyterman and de Graaf had pointed out that there might be a way to start a reaction in an enzyme crystal by diffusion and following its catalytic cycle in its entirety with crystallographic methods. The crystal only has to be thin enough so that the diffusion is not rate limiting. Of course, the key questions are as follows: How thin should the crystal be? Will the existing X-ray sources be able to collect data from a thin enough crystal fast enough? This review shines light on these questions.},

The resolution is pushed to 1.46\,Å, and a PYP structural model is refined at that resolution. The result is compared to other PYP models determined at atomic resolution around 1\,Å and better at the synchrotron. By comparing subtleties such as individual isotropic temperature factors and hydrogen bond lengths, we were able to assess the quality of the SFX data at that resolution. We also show that the determination of anisotropic temperature factor ellipsoids starts to become feasible with the SFX data at resolutions better than 1.5\,Å.},

  abstract = {The focus of structural biology is shifting from the determination of static structures to the investigation of dynamical aspects of macromolecular function. With time-resolved macromolecular crystallography (TRX), intermediates that form and decay during the macromolecular reaction can be investigated, as well as their reaction dynamics. Time-resolved crystallographic methods were initially developed at synchrotrons. However, about a decade ago, extremely brilliant, femtosecond-pulsed X-ray sources, the free electron lasers for hard X-rays, became available to a wider community. TRX is now possible with femtosecond temporal resolution. This review provides an overview of methodological aspects of TRX, and at the same time, aims to outline the frontiers of this method at modern pulsed X-ray sources.},

  abstract = {A detailed mechanistic understanding of how a protein functions requires knowledge not only of its static structure, but also how its conformation evolves as it executes its function. The recent development of picosecond time-resolved X-ray crystallography has allowed us to visualize in real time and with atomic detail the conformational evolution of a protein. Here, we report the photolysis-induced structural evolution of wild-type and L29F myoglobin over times ranging from 100ps to 3μs. The sub-ns structural rearrangements that accompany ligand dissociation in wild-type and the mutant form differ dramatically, and lead to vastly different ligand migration dynamics. The correlated protein displacements provide a structural explanation for the kinetic differences. Our observation of functionally important protein motion on the sub-ns time scale was made possible by the 150-ps time resolution of the measurement, and demonstrates that picosecond dynamics are relevant to protein function. To visualize subtle structural changes without modeling, we developed a novel method for rendering time-resolved electron density that depicts motion as a color gradient across the atom or group of atoms that move. A sequence of these time-resolved images have been stitched together into a movie, which allows one to literally “watch” the protein as it executes its function.},

At low resolution, the building and refinement of atomic models is a more challenging task. The deformable elastic network (DEN) refinement method developed previously has been instrumental in the determinion of several structures at low resolution. Here, DEN refinement is reviewed, recommendations for its optimal usage are provided and its limitations are discussed. Representative examples of the application of DEN refinement to challenging cases of refinement at low resolution are presented. These cases include soluble as well as membrane proteins determined at limiting resolutions ranging from 3 to 7 Å. Potential extensions of the DEN refinement technique and future perspectives for the interpretation of low-resolution crystal structures are also discussed.},

Accordingly, any time-resolved experiment must be matched to the speed of the structural changes of interest. Therefore, the timescale of interest defines the requirements of the X-ray source, instrumentation and data-collection strategy. In this study, a minimalistic approach for in situ crystallization is presented that requires only a few microlitres of sample solution containing a few hundred crystals. It is demonstrated that complete diffraction data sets, merged from multiple crystals, can be recorded within only a few minutes of beamtime and allow high-resolution structural information of high quality to be obtained with a temporal resolution of 40\>ms. Global and site-specific radiation damage can be avoided by limiting the maximal dose per crystal to 400\>kGy. Moreover, analysis of the data collected at higher doses allows the time-resolved observation of site-specific radiation damage. Therefore, our approach is well suited to observe structural changes and possibly enzymatic reactions in the low-millisecond regime.},

  abstract = {Current fluorescent protein (FP) development strategies are focused on fine-tuning the photophysical properties of blue to yellow variants derived from the Aequorea victoria jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) and on the development of monomeric FPs from other organisms that emit in the yellow-orange to far-red regions of the visible light spectrum. Progress toward these goals has been substantial, and near-infrared emitting FPs may loom over the horizon. The latest efforts in jellyfish variants have resulted in new and improved monomeric BFP, CFP, GFP and YFP variants, and the relentless search for a bright, monomeric and fast-maturing red FP has yielded a host of excellent candidates, although none is yet optimal for all applications. Meanwhile, photoactivatable FPs are emerging as a powerful class of probes for intracellular dynamics and, unexpectedly, as useful tools for the development of superresolution microscopy applications.},

Recent developments in SHELXL facilitate refinement against neutron diffraction data, the treatment of H atoms, the determination of absolute structure, the input of partial structure factors and the refinement of twinned and disordered structures.

For this process to function properly, timing is essential: The channel must be closed after collection of the protons to be pumped and before Fea oxidation. If the channel were to remain open, spontaneous backflow of the collected protons would occur. For elucidation of the channel closure mechanism, the opening of the channel, which occurs upon release of CO from CcO, is investigated by newly developed time-resolved x-ray free-electron laser and infrared techniques with nanosecond time resolution. The opening process indicates that CuB senses completion of proton collection and binds O2 before binding to Fea3 to close the water channel using a conformational relay system, which includes CuB, heme a3, and a transmembrane helix, to block backflow of the collected protons.},

  abstract = {“Proton-collecting antenna” are conjectured to consist of several carboxylates within hydrogen-bond (HB) networks on the surface of proteins, which funnel protons to the orifice of an internal proton wire leading to the protein’s active site. Yet such constructions were never directly visualized. Here we report an X-ray structure of green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the highest resolution to date (0.9 Å). It allows the identification of some pivotal hydrogen atoms pertinent to uncertainties concerning the protonation state of the chromophore. Applying a computer algorithm for mapping proton wires in proteins reveals the previously observed “active site wire” connecting Glu222 with the surface carboxylate Glu5. In addition, it is now possible to identify what appears to be a proton-collecting apparatus of GFP. It consists of a negative surface patch containing carboxylates, threonines, and water molecules, connected by a HB network to Glu5. Furthermore, we detect exit points via Asn146 and His148 to a hydrophobic surface region. The more extensive HB network of the present structure, as compared with earlier GFP structures, is not accidental. A systematic investigation of over 100 mutants shows a clear correlation between the observed water content of GFP X-ray structures and their resolution. With increasing water content, the proton wires become progressively larger. These findings corroborate the scenario in which the photodissociated proton from wild-type GFP can leak outside, whereafter another proton is recruited via the proton-collecting apparatus reported herein.},

  abstract = {Thanks to recent technological advances in X-ray and micro-electron diffraction and solid-state NMR, structural information can be obtained by using much smaller crystals. Thus, microcrystals have become a valuable commodity rather than a mere stepping stone toward obtaining macroscopic crystals. Microcrystals are particularly useful for structure determination using serial data collection approaches at synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers. The latter’s enormous peak brilliance and short X-ray pulse duration mean that structural information can be obtained before the effects of radiation damage are seen; these properties also facilitate time-resolved crystallography. To establish defined reaction initiation conditions, microcrystals with a desired and narrow size distribution are critical. Here, we describe milling and seeding techniques as well as filtration approaches for the reproducible and size-adjustable preparation of homogeneous nano- and microcrystals. Nanocrystals and crystal seeds can be obtained by milling using zirconium beads and the BeadBug homogenizer; fragmentation of large crystals yields micro- or nanocrystals by flowing crystals through stainless steel filters by using an HPLC pump. The approaches can be scaled to generate micro- to milliliter quantities of microcrystals, starting from macroscopic crystals. The procedure typically takes 3–5 d, including the time required to grow the microcrystals.},

  abstract = {Much of our current understanding of how small-molecule ligands interact with proteins stems from X-ray crystal structures determined at cryogenic (cryo) temperature. For proteins alone, room-temperature (RT) crystallography can reveal previously hidden, biologically relevant alternate conformations. However, less is understood about how RT crystallography may impact the conformational landscapes of protein-ligand complexes. Previously, we showed that small-molecule fragments cluster in putative allosteric sites using a cryo crystallographic screen of the therapeutic target PTP1B (Keedy et al., 2018). Here, we have performed two RT crystallographic screens of PTP1B using many of the same fragments, representing the largest RT crystallographic screens of a diverse library of ligands to date, and enabling a direct interrogation of the effect of data collection temperature on protein-ligand interactions. We show that at RT, fewer ligands bind, and often more weakly – but with a variety of temperature-dependent differences, including unique binding poses, changes in solvation, new binding sites, and distinct protein allosteric conformational responses. Overall, this work suggests that the vast body of existing cryo-temperature protein-ligand structures may provide an incomplete picture, and highlights the potential of RT crystallography to help complete this picture by revealing distinct conformational modes of protein-ligand systems. Our results may inspire future use of RT crystallography to interrogate the roles of protein-ligand conformational ensembles in biological function.},

  abstract = {Light-driven sodium pumps actively transport small cations across cellular membranes1. These pumps are used by microorganisms to convert light into membrane potential and have become useful optogenetic tools with applications in neuroscience. Although the resting state structures of the prototypical sodium pump Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2) have been solved2,3, it is unclear how structural alterations over time allow sodium to be translocated against a concentration gradient. Here, using the Swiss X-ray Free Electron Laser4, we have collected serial crystallographic data at ten pump–probe delays from femtoseconds to milliseconds. High-resolution structural snapshots throughout the KR2 photocycle show how retinal isomerization is completed on the femtosecond timescale and changes the local structure of the binding pocket in the early nanoseconds. Subsequent rearrangements and deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base open an electrostatic gate in microseconds. Structural and spectroscopic data, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, indicate that a sodium ion binds transiently close to the retinal within one millisecond. In the last structural intermediate, at 20 milliseconds after activation, we identified a potential second sodium-binding site close to the extracellular exit. These results provide direct molecular insight into the dynamics of active cation transport across biological membranes.},

We use time-resolved mix-and-inject serial crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to observe catalysis in a designed mutant isocyanide hydratase (ICH) enzyme that enhances sampling of important minor conformations. The active site exists in a mixture of conformations, and formation of the thioimidate intermediate selects for catalytically competent substates. The influence of cysteine ionization on the ICH ensemble is validated by determining structures of the enzyme at multiple pH values. Large molecular dynamics simulations in crystallo and time-resolved electron density maps show that Asp17 ionizes during catalysis and causes conformational changes that propagate across the dimer, permitting water to enter the active site for intermediate hydrolysis. ICH exhibits a tight coupling between ionization of active site residues and catalysis-activated protein motions, exemplifying a mechanism of electrostatic control of enzyme dynamics.},

  abstract = {KAMO and BLEND provide particularly effective tools to automatically manage the merging of large numbers of data sets from serial crystallography. The requirement for manual intervention in the process can be reduced by extending BLEND to support additional clustering options such as the use of more accurate cell distance metrics and the use of reflection-intensity correlation coefficients to infer `distances' among sets of reflections. This increases the sensitivity to differences in unit-cell parameters and allows clustering to assemble nearly complete data sets on the basis of intensity or amplitude differences. If the data sets are already sufficiently complete to permit it, one applies KAMO once and clusters the data using intensities only. When starting from incomplete data sets, one applies KAMO twice, first using unit-cell parameters. In this step, either the simple cell vector distance of the original BLEND or the more sensitive NCDist is used. This step tends to find clusters of sufficient size such that, when merged, each cluster is sufficiently complete to allow reflection intensities or amplitudes to be compared. One then uses KAMO again using the correlation between reflections with a common hkl to merge clusters in a way that is sensitive to structural differences that may not have perturbed the unit-cell parameters sufficiently to make meaningful clusters. Many groups have developed effective clustering algorithms that use a measurable physical parameter from each diffraction still or wedge to cluster the data into categories which then can be merged, one hopes, to yield the electron density from a single protein form. Since these physical parameters are often largely independent of one another, it should be possible to greatly improve the efficacy of data-clustering software by using a multi-stage partitioning strategy. Here, one possible approach to multi-stage data clustering is demonstrated. The strategy is to use unit-cell clustering until the merged data are sufficiently complete and then to use intensity-based clustering. Using this strategy, it is demonstrated that it is possible to accurately cluster data sets from crystals that have subtle differences.},

  abstract = {Phototropins, a class of light-activated protein kinases, are essential for several blue light responses in plants and algae, including phototropism. These proteins contain two internal light, oxygen, and voltage sensitive (LOV) domains, which bind flavin chromophores and undergo a reversible photochemical formation of a cysteinyl-flavin adduct as part of the light sensing process. While the photodynamic properties of such photosensory domains are dictated by interactions between the chromophore and surrounding protein, more distant residues can play a significant role as well. Here we explore the role of the Phe434 residue in the photosensory response of the second LOV domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV2), a model photochemical system for these LOV domains. Phe434 is more than 6 Å from the FMN chromophore in AsLOV2; nevertheless, an F434Y point mutation is likely to change several structural features of the chromophore binding site, as we demonstrate using molecular dynamics simulations. Transient absorption signals spanning 15 decades in time were compared for wild-type AsLOV2 and the F434Y mutant, showing that the latter has significantly altered photodynamics, including (i) a faster intersystem crossing leading to triplet formation on a nanosecond time scale, (ii) biphasic formation of adduct-state kinetics on the microsecond time scale, and (iii) greatly accelerated ground-state recovery kinetics on a second time scale. We present mechanistic models that link these spectroscopic differences to changes in the configuration of the critical cysteine residue and in the chromophore’s accessibility to solvent and oxygen according to MD trajectories and purging experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of residues outside the chromophore-binding pocket in modulating LOV domain photodynamics.},

  abstract = {With advances in X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has enabled the static and dynamic structure determination for challenging proteins such as membrane protein complexes. In SFX with XFELs, the crystals are typically destroyed after interacting with a single XFEL pulse. Therefore, thousands of new crystals must be sequentially introduced into the X-ray beam to collect full data sets. Because of the serial nature of any SFX experiment, up to 99\% of the sample delivered to the X-ray beam during its “off-time” between X-ray pulses is wasted due to the intrinsic pulsed nature of all current XFELs. To solve this major problem of large and often limiting sample consumption, we report on improvements of a revolutionary sample-saving method that is compatible with all current XFELs. We previously reported 3D-printed injection devices coupled with gas dynamic virtual nozzles (GDVNs) capable of generating samples containing droplets segmented by an immiscible oil phase for jetting crystal-laden droplets into the path of an XFEL. Here, we have further improved the device design by including metal electrodes inducing electrowetting effects for improved control over droplet generation frequency to stimulate the droplet release to matching the XFEL repetition rate by employing an electrical feedback mechanism. We report the improvements in this electrically triggered segmented flow approach for sample conservation in comparison with a continuous GDVN injection using the microcrystals of lysozyme and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase and report the segmented flow approach for sample injection applied at the Macromolecular Femtosecond Crystallography instrument at the Linear Coherent Light Source for the first time.},

Here, we show that the microalga Chlorella variabilis NC64A harbors a photoenzyme that acts in lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the decarboxylation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acid–binding site in a hydrophobic tunnel leading to the light-capturing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The decarboxylation is initiated through electron abstraction from the fatty acid by the photoexcited FAD with a quantum yield {$>$}80\%. This photoenzyme, which we name fatty acid photodecarboxylase, may be useful in light-driven, bio-based production of hydrocarbons.},

The dose dependence of radiation damage to eight lysozyme crystals at room temperature (292 K) was investigated in order to provide an accurate comparison with cryotemperature (100 K) results and to allow researchers to calculate expected maximum room-temperature-crystal lifetimes prior to data collection. Results of intensity-loss analysis unexpectedly showed that the dose tolerated by a crystal is dependent on the dose rate according to a positive linear relationship (99\% correlation coefficient); a 60\% increase in dose rate gave a 4-fold increase in crystal lifetime over the range studied. Alternative metrics of damage were also assessed from room temperature data. In the dose-rate range tested (6 Gy s-1 to 10 Gy s-1), data collection at 100 K appears to offer a 26–113 times increase in the lifetime of the crystal.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular crystallography was immensely successful in the last two decades. To a large degree this success resulted from use of powerful third generation synchrotron x-ray sources. An expansive database of more than 100\,000 protein structures, of which many were determined at resolution better than 2 Å, is available today. With this achievement, the spotlight in structural biology is shifting from determination of static structures to elucidating dynamic aspects of protein function. A powerful tool for addressing these aspects is timeresolved crystallography, where a genuine biological function is triggered in the crystal with a goal of capturing molecules in action and determining protein kinetics and structures of intermediates (Schmidt et al 2005a Methods Mol. Biol. 305 115–54, Schmidt 2008 Ultrashort Laser Pulses in Biology and Medicine (Berlin: Springer) pp 201–41, Neutze and Moffat 2012 Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 22 651–9, Šrajer 2014 The Future of Dynamic Structural Science (Berlin: Springer) pp 237–51). In this approach, short and intense x-ray pulses are used to probe intermediates in real time and at room temperature, in an ongoing reaction that is initiated synchronously and rapidly in the crystal. Time-resolved macromolecular crystallography with 100\,ps time resolution at synchrotron x-ray sources is in its mature phase today, particularly for studies of reversible, light-initiated reactions. The advent of the new free electron lasers for hard x-rays (XFELs; 5–20\,keV), which provide exceptionally intense, femtosecond x-ray pulses, marks a new frontier for time-resolved crystallography. The exploration of ultra-fast events becomes possible in high-resolution structural detail, on sub-picosecond time scales (Tenboer et al 2014 Science 346 1242–6, Barends et al 2015 Science 350 445–50, Pande et al 2016 Science 352 725–9). We review here state-of-the-art time-resolved crystallographic experiments both at synchrotrons and XFELs. We also outline challenges and further developments necessary to broaden the application of these methods to many important proteins and enzymes of biomedical relevance.},

Although they are more suitable than traditional methods for the analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary signals, they could be easily misused if their known limitations, together with the assumptions they rely on, are not carefully considered. In this work, we examine the main pitfalls and provide caveats for the proper use of the EMD- and IF-based algorithms. Specifically, we address the problems related to boundary errors, to the presence of spikes or jumps in the signal and to the decomposition of highly-stochastic signals. The consequences of an improper usage of these techniques are discussed and clarified also by analysing real data and performing numerical simulations. Finally, we provide the reader with the best practices to maximize the quality and meaningfulness of the decomposition produced by these techniques. In particular, a technique for the extension of signal to reduce the boundary effects is proposed; a careful handling of spikes and jumps in the signal is suggested; the concept of multi-scale statistical analysis is presented to treat highly stochastic signals.},

In order to determine the origins of this symmetry breaking, the internal electric field present in the RC when charge is separated onto structurally characterized sites was probed by using absorption band shifts of the chromophores within the RC. The sensitivity of each probe chromophore to an electric field was calibrated by measuring the Stark effect spectrum, the change in absorption due to an externally applied electric field. A quantitative comparison of the observed absorption band shifts and those predicted from vacuum electrostatics gives information on the effective dielectric constant of the protein complex. These results reveal a significant asymmetry in the effective dielectric strength of the protein complex along the two potential electron transfer pathways, with a substantially higher dielectric strength along the functional pathway. This dielectric asymmetry could be a dominant factor in determining the functional asymmetry of electron transfer in the RC.},

  abstract = {A new approach for collecting data from many hundreds of thousands of microcrystals using X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser has recently been developed. Referred to as serial crystallography, diffraction patterns are recorded at a constant rate as a suspension of protein crystals flows across the path of an X-ray beam. Events that by chance contain single-crystal diffraction patterns are retained, then indexed and merged to form a three-dimensional set of reflection intensities for structure determination. This approach relies upon several innovations: an intense X-ray beam; a fast detector system; a means to rapidly flow a suspension of crystals across the X-ray beam; and the computational infrastructure to process the large volume of data. Originally conceived for radiation-damage-free measurements with ultrafast X-ray pulses, the same methods can be employed with synchrotron radiation. As in powder diffraction, the averaging of thousands of observations per Bragg peak may improve the ratio of signal to noise of low-dose exposures. Here, it is shown that this paradigm can be implemented for room-temperature data collection using synchrotron radiation and exposure times of less than 3 ms. Using lysozyme microcrystals as a model system, over 40 000 single-crystal diffraction patterns were obtained and merged to produce a structural model that could be refined to 2.1 Å resolution. The resulting electron density is in excellent agreement with that obtained using standard X-ray data collection techniques. With further improvements the method is well suited for even shorter exposures at future and upgraded synchrotron radiation facilities that may deliver beams with 1000 times higher brightness than they currently produce.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular function frequently requires that~proteins change~conformation into high-energy states1–4. However, methods for solving the structures of these functionally essential, lowly populated states~are lacking. Here we develop a method for high-resolution structure determination of minorly~populated states by coupling NMR spectroscopy-derived pseudocontact shifts5 (PCSs) with Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion6 (PCS–CPMG). Our approach additionally defines the corresponding kinetics and thermodynamics of high-energy excursions, thereby characterizing the entire free-energy landscape. Using a large set of simulated data for adenylate kinase~(Adk), calmodulin and Src kinase, we find that high-energy PCSs accurately determine high-energy structures (with a root mean squared deviation of less than 3.5\,angström). Applying our methodology to Adk during catalysis, we find that the high-energy excursion involves surprisingly small openings of the AMP and ATP lids. This previously unresolved high-energy structure solves a longstanding controversy about conformational interconversions that are rate-limiting for catalysis. Primed for either substrate binding or product release, the high-energy structure of Adk suggests a two-step mechanism combining conformational selection to this state, followed by an induced-fit step into a fully closed state for catalysis of the phosphoryl-transfer reaction. Unlike other methods for resolving high-energy states, such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, our solution PCS–CPMG approach excels in cases involving domain rearrangements of smaller systems (less than 60\,kDa) and populations as low as 0.5\%, and enables the simultaneous determination of protein structure, kinetics and thermodynamics while proteins perform their function.},

  abstract = {Serial femtosecond crystallography for small-unit-cell systems has so far seen very limited application despite obvious scientific possibilities. This is because reliable data reduction has not been available for these challenging systems. In particular, important intensity corrections such as the partiality correction critically rely on accurate determination of the crystal orientation, which is complicated by the low number of diffraction spots for small-unit-cell crystals. A data reduction pipeline capable of fully automated handling of all steps of data reduction from spot harvesting to merged structure factors has been developed. The pipeline utilizes sparse indexing based on known unit-cell parameters, seed-skewness integration, intensity corrections including an overlap-based combined Ewald sphere width and partiality correction, and a dynamically adjusted post-refinement routine. Using the pipeline, data measured on the compound K4[Pt2(P2O5H2)4]·2H2O have been successfully reduced and used to solve the structure to an R1 factor of ∼9.1\%. It is expected that the pipeline will open up the field of small-unit-cell serial femtosecond crystallography experiments and allow investigations into, for example, excited states and reaction intermediate chemistry.},

The ensuing reaction was monitored by collection of sequential, single-exposure Laue x-ray diffraction patterns. The experiment was also performed in solution to verify the regeneration of catalytic activity and the subsequent inhibition of the enzyme by pyrone after photolysis. The resulting crystallographic structures show the presence ofcovalently bound cinnamate prior to photolysis, the generation of "free" enzyme after irradiation ofthe crystal, and the slow formation of a pyrone-inhibited complex several hours after photolysis. The structure of the free enzyme shows a significant proportion of the active sites in the crystal to contain a naturally occurring, noncovalently bound tetrapeptide inhibitor [Dixon, M. M. \& Matthews, B. W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 7033-7038], even after cinnamate acylation and photolysis. Data collected simultaneously with irradiation show the crystal to be slightly disordered during photolysis, leading to streaked x-ray photos. The resulting maps are suggestive of a bicyclic coumarin species produced by photolysis and deacylation; however, the electron density is difficult to model unambiguously by one unique chemical state. Nevertheless, Laue crystallography is shown to be capable of visualizing time-dependent chemical changes in the active site of an enzyme.},

Increasing the X-ray energy beyond the typical 10–15 keV range promises to provide an extension of crystal lifetime via an increase in diffraction efficiency. To date, however, hardware limitations have negated any possible gains. Through the first use of a cadmium telluride EIGER2 detector and a beamline optimized for high-energy data collection, it is shown that at higher energies fewer crystals will be required to obtain complete data, as the diffracted intensity per unit dose increases by a factor of more than two between 12.4 and 25 keV. Additionally, these higher energy data can provide more information, as shown by a systematic increase in the high-resolution cutoff of the data collected. Taken together, these gains point to a high-energy future for synchrotron-based macromolecular crystallography.},

The advantage of XFEL is an intense pulse of X-rays and a very short pulse duration ({$<$}10\,fs) promising a damage-free and time-resolved crystallography approach. Scope of review Recent time-resolved crystallographic analyses in XFEL facility SACLA are reviewed. Specifically, metalloproteins involved in the essential reactions of bioenergy conversion including photosystem II, cytochrome c oxidase and nitric oxide reductase are described. Major conclusions XFEL with pump-probe techniques successfully visualized the process of the reaction and the dynamics of a protein. Since the active center of metalloproteins is very sensitive to the X-ray radiation, damage-free structures obtained by XFEL are essential to draw mechanistic conclusions. Methods and tools for sample delivery and reaction initiation are key for successful measurement of the time-resolved data. General significance XFEL is at the center of approaches to gain insight into complex mechanism of structural dynamics and the reactions catalyzed by biological macromolecules. Further development has been carried out to expand the application of time-resolved X-ray crystallography.

  abstract = {The plant blue light receptor, phot1, a member of the phototropin family (1), is a plasma membrane-associated flavoprotein that contains two (∼110 amino acids) flavin-binding domains, LOV1 and LOV2, within its N terminus and a typical serine-threonine protein kinase domain at its C terminus. The LOV (light, oxygen, and voltage) domains belong to the PAS domain superfamily of sensor proteins. In response to blue light, phototropins undergo autophosphorylation.E. coli-expressed LOV domains bind riboflavin-5′-monophosphate, are photochemically active, and have major absorption peaks at 360 and 450 nm, with the 450 nm peak having vibronic structure at 425 and 475 nm. These spectral features correspond to the action spectrum for phototropism in higher plants. Blue light excitation of the LOV2 domain generates, in less than 30 ns, a transient ∼660 nm-absorbing species that spectroscopically resembles a flavin triplet state. This putative triplet state subsequently decays with a 4-μs time constant into a 390 nm-absorbing metastable form. The LOV2 domain (450 nm) recovers spontaneously with half-times of ∼50 s. It has been shown that the metastable species is likely a flavin-cysteine (Cys39 thiol) adduct at the flavin C(4a) position. A LOV2C39A mutant generates the early photoproduct but not the adduct. Titrations of LOV2 using chromophore fluorescence as an indicator suggest that Cys39 exists as a thiolate.},

  abstract = {Phototropins (phot1 and phot2), the plant blue-light receptors for phototropism, chloroplast movement, and stomatal opening, are flavoproteins that contain two ∼12 kDa FMN-binding domains, LOV1 and LOV2, at their N-terminus, and a serine/threonine protein kinase domain at their C-terminus. The light-activated LOV2 domain forms a metastable intermediate which has been shown to be a protein-chromophore cysteinyl adduct (Cys39) at C(4a) of FMN. This species thermally relaxes back to the ground state in the dark. We measured the light-minus-dark FTIR difference spectra for the LOV2 domain of oat phot1. These spectra show the disappearance of bands at 1580, 1550, and 1350 cm-1 that originate from, or are strongly coupled to, the N5C(4a) stretching vibrations, consistent with the perturbations expected upon C(4a) adduct formation. Assignment of these negative difference FTIR bands to native chromophore vibrations is based on the alignment with resonance Raman bands of FMN. Prominent positive bands include a doublet at 1516 and 1536 cm-1 and one at 1375 and 1298 cm-1. Normal-mode vibrational-frequency calculations for both lumiflavin and lumiflavin with a sulfur attached at the C(4a) position agree with many of the positive and negative bands observed in the difference spectra. Both calculated and experimental difference FTIR spectra for deuterium isotope substitutions at exchangeable positions in the flavin chromophore are consistent with the assignment of the above positive bands to vibrational modes involving both the newly formed tetrahedral geometry of C(4a) and the N5-H bond in the long-lived LOV2S390 cysteinyl species.},

The patterns were recorded on a sensitive storage-phosphor detector. Despite complexities posed by the sharp variation of the incident X-ray spectrum with wavelength and the weakness of the diffraction patterns, accurate crystallographic structure amplitudes were extracted from the Laue intensities by the generalized scale-factor approach to the determination of the wavelength- and position-dependent correction factors. The results show that crystallography is feasible on the 100 ps time scale and open up the prospect of time-resolved measurements of ultra-rapid changes in molecular structure.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY               PAS domains are newly recognized signaling domains that are widely distributed in proteins from members of the Archaea and Bacteria and from fungi, plants, insects, and vertebrates. They function as input modules in proteins that sense oxygen, redox potential, light, and some other stimuli. Specificity in sensing arises, in part, from different cofactors that may be associated with the PAS fold. Transduction of redox signals may be a common mechanistic theme in many different PAS domains. PAS proteins are always located intracellularly but may monitor the external as well as the internal environment. One way in which prokaryotic PAS proteins sense the environment is by detecting changes in the electron transport system. This serves as an early warning system for any reduction in cellular energy levels. Human PAS proteins include hypoxia-inducible factors and voltage-sensitive ion channels; other PAS proteins are integral components of circadian clocks. Although PAS domains were only recently identified, the signaling functions with which they are associated have long been recognized as fundamental properties of living cells.},

Here we assess the accuracy of AlphaFold predictions by comparing them to density maps obtained from automated redeterminations of recent crystal structures and to the corresponding deposited models. Some AlphaFold predictions match experimental maps closely, but most differ on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. Such differences occur even in parts of AlphaFold models that were predicted with high confidence. Generally, the dissimilarities exceed those between high-resolution pairs of structures containing the same components but determined in different space groups. Therefore, while AlphaFold predictions are useful hypotheses about protein structures, experimental information remains essential for creating an accurate model. One-Sentence Summary AlphaFold predictions can be very accurate but should be treated as hypotheses as even high-confidence parts can be inconsistent with experimental data.},

In cases where substantial correlated model errors exist or where there are differences in the quality of the two experimental data sets (cases quite common in macromolecular crystallography), independent refinement of the two structures does not lead to the most accurate estimate of the differences between them. An alternative procedure that has proven effective in some such cases is difference refinement, in which the residual between observed and calculated differences in structure-factor amplitudes between the two structures is minimized. A Bayesian approach has been used to extend the range of applicability of difference refinement to cases where there is only partial correlation in model errors and where the overlap between the data sets is limited. The resulting method, Bayesian difference refinement, uses residuals to be minimized that vary smoothly between difference refinement and independent refinement. When the errors in the two structural models are very similar, difference refinement is used; when they are very different, independent refinement is used; and when they are partially correlated, a combination of the two is used. The procedure is very simple to apply and does not significantly increase the computational demands of refinement.},

  abstract = {Temperature is an important state variable that governs the behavior of microscopic systems, yet crystallographers rarely exploit temperature changes to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. In fact, approximately 90\% of crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank were determined under cryogenic conditions, because sample cryocooling makes crystals robust to X-ray radiation damage and facilitates data collection. On the other hand, cryocooling can introduce artifacts into macromolecular structures, and can suppress conformational dynamics that are critical for function. Fortunately, recent advances in X-ray detector technology, X-ray sources, and computational data processing algorithms make non-cryogenic X-ray crystallography easier and more broadly applicable than ever before. Without the reliance on cryocooling, high-resolution crystallography can be combined with various temperature perturbations to gain deep insight into the conformational landscapes of macromolecules. This Chapter reviews the historical reasons for the prevalence of cryocooling in macromolecular crystallography, and discusses its potential drawbacks. Next, the Chapter summarizes technological developments and methodologies that facilitate non-cryogenic crystallography experiments. Finally, the chapter discusses the theoretical underpinnings and practical aspects of multi-temperature and temperature-jump crystallography experiments, which are powerful tools for understanding the relationship between the structure, dynamics, and function of proteins and other biological macromolecules.},

Time-resolved X-ray methods hold promise for addressing this challenge, but have relied on the exploitation of exotic protein photoactivity, and are therefore not generalizable. Temperature jumps, through thermal excitation of the solvent, have been utilized to study protein dynamics using spectroscopic techniques, but their implementation in X-ray scattering experiments has been limited. Here, we perform temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A, demonstrating that these experiments are able to capture functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale. We show that cyclophilin A displays rich dynamics following a temperature jump, and use the resulting time-resolved signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes. Two relaxation processes are resolved: a fast process is related to surface loop motions, and a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover.},

Competition from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and micro-electron diffraction, increased interest in functionally relevant information that may be missing or corrupted in structures determined at cryogenic temperature, and interest in time-resolved studies of the biomolecular response to chemical and optical stimuli have driven renewed interest in data collection at room temperature and, more generally, at temperatures from the protein–solvent glass transition near 200 K to ∼350 K. Fischer has recently reviewed practical methods for room-temperature data collection and analysis [Fischer (2021), Q. Rev. Biophys. 54, e1]. Here, the key advantages and physical principles of, and methods for, crystallographic data collection at noncryogenic temperatures and some factors relevant to interpreting the resulting data are discussed. For room-temperature data collection to realize its potential within the structural biology toolkit, streamlined and standardized methods for delivering crystals prepared in the home laboratory to the synchrotron and for automated handling and data collection, similar to those for cryocrystallography, should be implemented.},

The mechanism of signaling transduction in the PtAu1a LOV domain (AuLOV) including flanking helices remains unclear because of this dissimilarity, which hinders the study of PtAu1a as an optogenetic tool. To clarify this mechanism, we employed a combination of tree-based machine learning models, Markov state models, machine-learning-based community analysis, and transition path theory to quantitatively analyze the allosteric process. Our results are in good agreement with the reported experimental findings and reveal a previously overlooked Cα helix and protein linkers as important in promoting the protein conformational changes. This integrated approach can be considered as a general workflow and applied on other allosteric proteins to provide detailed information about their allosteric mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The primary step in the mechanism by which migratory birds sense the Earth’s magnetic field is thought to be the light-induced formation of long-lived magnetically sensitive radical pairs within cryptochrome flavoproteins located in the birds’ retinas. Blue-light absorption by the non-covalently bound flavin chromophore triggers sequential electron transfers along a chain of four tryptophan residues toward the photoexcited flavin. The recently demonstrated ability to express cryptochrome 4a from the night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula), ErCry4a, and to replace each of the tryptophan residues by a redox-inactive phenylalanine offers the prospect of exploring the roles of the four tryptophans. Here, we use ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy to compare wild type ErCry4a and four mutants having a phenylalanine at different positions in the chain. We find that each of the three tryptophan residues closest to the flavin adds a distinct relaxation component (time constants: 0.5, 30, and 150 ps) in the transient absorption data. The dynamics of the mutant containing a phenylalanine at the fourth position, furthest from the flavin, are very similar to those of wild type ErCry4a, except for a reduced concentration of long-lived radical pairs. The experimental results are evaluated and discussed in the framework of real-time quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical electron transfer simulations based on the density functional-based tight binding approach. This comparison between simulation results and experimental measurements provides a detailed microscopic insight into the sequential electron transfers along the tryptophan chain. Our results offer a route to the study of spin transport and dynamical spin correlations in flavoprotein radical pairs.},

  abstract = {miniSOG is the first flavin-binding protein that has been developed with the specific aim of serving as a genetically-encodable light-induced source of singlet oxygen (1O2). We have determined its 1.17\,Å resolution structure, which has allowed us to investigate its mechanism of photosensitization using an integrated approach combining spectroscopic and structural methods. Our results provide a structural framework to explain the ability of miniSOG to produce 1O2 as a competition between oxygen- and protein quenching of its triplet state. In addition, a third excited-state decay pathway has been identified that is pivotal for the performance of miniSOG as 1O2 photosensitizer, namely the photo-induced transformation of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) into lumichrome, which increases the accessibility of oxygen to the flavin FMN chromophore and makes protein quenching less favourable. The combination of the two effects explains the increase in the 1O2 quantum yield by one order of magnitude upon exposure to blue light. Besides, we have identified several surface electron-rich residues that are progressively photo-oxidized, further contributing to facilitate the production of 1O2. Our results help reconcile the apparent poor level of 1O2 generation by miniSOG and its excellent performance in correlative light and electron microscopy experiments.},

Here we demonstrate the application of this method using fungal NO reductase, a heme-containing enzyme, at room temperature. Twenty milliseconds after caged-NO photolysis, we identify a NO-bound form of the enzyme, which is an initial intermediate with a slightly bent Fe-N-O coordination geometry at a resolution of 2.1\,Å. The NO geometry is compatible with those analyzed by XFEL-based cryo-crystallography and QM/MM calculations, indicating that we obtain an intact Fe3+-NO coordination structure that is free of X-ray radiation damage. The slightly bent NO geometry is appropriate to prevent immediate NO dissociation and thus accept H- from NADH. The combination of using XFEL and a caged-compound is a powerful tool for determining functional enzyme structures during catalytic reactions at the atomic level.},

A number of spectroscopic techniques are available that probe local structural rearrangements with high temporal resolution. However, for macromolecules, these techniques do not yield an overall high-resolution description of the structure. Time-resolved X-ray crystallographic methods exist, but, due to both instrument availability and stringent sample requirements, they have not been widely applied to macromolecular systems, especially for time resolutions below 1~s. Recently, there has been a resurgent interest in time-resolved structural science, fuelled by the recognition that both chemical and life scientists face many of the same challenges. In the present article, we review the current state-of-the-art in dynamic structural science, highlighting applications to enzymes. We also look to the future and discuss current method developments with the potential to widen access to time-resolved studies across discipline boundaries.},

The rapid spinning of the crystal within a levitating droplet ensured an efficient sampling of the reciprocal space. The datasets were processed with a program suite developed for serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). The structure, which was solved by molecular replacement, was found to be identical to the structure obtained by the conventional oscillation method for up to a 1.8-Å resolution limit. In particular, the absence of protein crystal damage resulting from the acoustic levitation was carefully established. These results represent a key step towards a fully automated sample handling and measurement pipeline, which has promising prospects for a high acquisition rate and high sample efficiency for room temperature X-ray crystallography.},

  abstract = {Abstract Chloride-sensitive fluorescent proteins generated from laboratory evolution have a characteristic tyrosine residue that interacts with a chloride ion and π-stacks with the chromophore. However, the engineered yellow-green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen lacks this interaction but still binds chloride, as seen in a recently reported crystal structure. Based on its unique coordination sphere, we were curious if chloride could influence the optical properties of mNeonGreen. Here, we present the structure-guided identification and spectroscopic characterization of mNeonGreen as a turn-on fluorescent protein sensor for chloride. Our results show that chloride binding lowers the chromophore pKa and shifts the equilibrium away from the weakly fluorescent phenol form to the highly fluorescent phenolate form, resulting in a pH-dependent, turn-on fluorescence response. Moreover, through mutagenesis, we link this sensing mechanism to a non-coordinating residue in the chloride binding pocket. This discovery sets the stage to further engineer mNeonGreen as a new fluorescent protein-based tool for imaging cellular chloride.},

Data were collected at the Structural Biology I beamline (BL41XU) at SPring-8, using 30 keV X-rays and a highly sensitive pixel array detector equipped with a cadmium telluride sensor. The experimental setup of continuous sample translation using multiple crystals allowed the average diffraction weighted dose per data set to be reduced to 58 kGy, and the resulting data revealed a ligand structure featuring an identical bond length to that in the damage-free structure determined using an X-ray free-electron laser. However, precise analysis of the residual density around the ligand structure refined with the synchrotron data showed the possibility of a small level of specific damage, which might have resulted from the accumulated dose of 58 kGy per data set. Further investigation of the photon-energy dependence of specific damage, as assessed by variations in UV-vis absorption spectra, was conducted using an on-line spectrometer at various energies ranging from 10 to 30 keV. No evidence was found for specific radiation damage being energy dependent.},

A successful time-resolved serial crystallography study requires the growth of microcrystals, a mechanism for synchronized and homogeneous excitation of the reaction of interest within microcrystals, and tools for structural interpretation. Here, we utilize time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography data collected from microcrystals of bacteriorhodopsin to compare results from partial occupancy structural refinement and refinement against extrapolated data. We illustrate the domain wherein the amplitude of refined conformational changes is inversely proportional to the activated state occupancy. We illustrate how resampling strategies allow coordinate uncertainty to be estimated and demonstrate that these two approaches to structural refinement agree within coordinate errors. We illustrate how singular value decomposition of a set of difference Fourier electron density maps calculated from resampled data can minimize phase bias in these maps, and we quantify residual densities for transient water molecules by analyzing difference Fourier and Polder omit maps from resampled data. We suggest that these tools may assist others in judging the confidence with which observed electron density differences may be interpreted as functionally important conformational changes.},

The ultrafast dynamics of these six systems is compared and spectral signatures of isomerization and solvation are discussed. We find that the ultrafast red-shifting of fluorescence is associated mostly with solvation dynamics, whereas isomerization manifests itself as quenching of fluorescence. The observed multiexponential quenching of the protein samples differs from the single-exponential lifetimes of the chromophores in solution. The locked chromophore in the protein environment decays faster than in solution. This is due to additional channels of excited-state energy dissipation via the covalent and hydrogen bonds with the protein environment. The observed large dispersion of quenching timescales observed in the protein samples that contain the native pigment favors both an inhomogeneous model and an excited-state barrier for isomerization.},

  abstract = {Metal-dependent formate dehydrogenases (Fdh) catalyze the reversible conversion of CO2 to formate, with unrivalled efficiency and selectivity. However, the key catalytic aspects of these enzymes remain unknown, preventing us from fully benefiting from their capabilities in terms of biotechnological applications. Here, we report a time-resolved characterization by X-ray crystallography of the Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough SeCys/W-Fdh during formate oxidation. The results allowed us to model five different intermediate structures and to chronologically map the changes occurring during enzyme reduction. Formate molecules were assigned for the first time to populate the catalytic pocket of a Fdh. Finally, the redox reversibility of DvFdhAB in crystals was confirmed by reduction and reoxidation structural studies.},

  abstract = {We have studied the fluorescence decays of the purified enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP, with chromophore sequence Thr-Trp-Gly) and of its variant carrying the single H148D mutation characteristic of the brighter form Cerulean. Both proteins exhibit highly complex fluorescence decays showing strong temperature and pH dependences. At neutral pH, the H148D mutation leads (i) to a general increase in all fluorescence lifetimes and (ii) to the disappearance of a subpopulation, estimated to be more than 25\% of the total ECFP molecules, characterized by a quenched and red-shifted fluorescence. The fluorescence lifetime distributions of ECFP and its H148D mutant remain otherwise very similar, indicating a high degree of structural and dynamic similarity of the two proteins in their major form. From thermodynamic analysis, we conclude that the multiexponential decay of ECFP cannot be simply ascribed, as is generally admitted, to the slow conformational exchange characterized by NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies [Seifert, M. H., et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 7932-7942; Bae, J. H., et al. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 328, 1071-1081]. Parallel measurements in living cells show that these fluorescence properties in neutral solution are very similar to those of cytosolic ECFP.},

  abstract = {Cryptochromes regulate the circadian clock in animals and plants. Humans and mice have two cryptochrome (Cry) genes. A previous study showed that mice lacking the Cry2 gene had reduced sensitivity to acute light induction of the circadian gene mPer1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and had an intrinsic period 1 hr longer than normal. In this study, Cry1-/- and Cry1-/-Cry2-/- mice were generated and their circadian clocks were analyzed at behavioral and molecular levels. Behaviorally, the Cry1-/- mice had a circadian period 1 hr shorter than wild type and the Cry1-/-Cry2-/- mice were arrhythmic in constant darkness (DD). Biochemically, acute light induction of mPer1 mRNA in the SCN was blunted in Cry1-/- and abolished in Cry1-/-Cry2-/- mice. In contrast, the acute light induction of mPer2 in the SCN was intact in Cry1-/- and Cry1-/-Cry2-/- animals. Importantly, in double mutants, mPer1 expression was constitutively elevated and no rhythmicity was detected in either 12-hr light/12-hr dark or DD, whereas mPer2 expression appeared rhythmic in 12-hr light/12-hr dark, but nonrhythmic in DD with intermediate levels. These results demonstrate that Cry1 and Cry2 are required for the normal expression of circadian behavioral rhythms, as well as circadian rhythms of mPer1 and mPer2 in the SCN. The differential regulation of mPer1 and mPer2 by light in Cry double mutants reveals a surprising complexity in the role of cryptochromes in mammals.},

Yet, the detailed photophysical processes at the basis of photoswitching have not been fully clarified. In this paper, we used synthetic FP chromophores to clarify the photophysical processes associated with the photochromic behavior. In particular, we investigated the spectral modification of synthetic chromophore analogues of wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP), Y66F GFP (BFPF), and Y66W GFP (CFP) upon irradiation in solutions of different polarities. We found that the cis-trans photoisomerization mechanism can be induced in all the chromophores. The structural assignments were carried out both by NMR measurements and DFT calculations. Remarkably, we determined for the first time the spectra of neutral trans isomers in different solvents. Finally, we calculated the photoconversion quantum yields by absorption measurements under continuous illumination at different times and by a nanosecond laser-flash photolysis method. Our results indicate that cis-trans photoisomerization is a general mechanism of FP chromophores whose efficiency is modulated by the detailed mutant-specific protein environment.},

  abstract = {A typical diffraction experiment will generate many images and data sets from different crystals in a very short time. This creates a challenge for the high-throughput operation of modern synchrotron beamlines as well as for the subsequent data processing. Novice users in particular may feel overwhelmed by the tables, plots and numbers that the different data-processing programs and software packages present to them. Here, some of the more common problems that a user has to deal with when processing a set of images that will finally make up a processed data set are shown, concentrating on difficulties that may often show up during the first steps along the path of turning the experiment (i.e. data collection) into a~model (i.e. interpreted electron density). Difficulties such as~unexpected crystal forms, issues in crystal handling and suboptimal choices of data-collection strategies can often be dealt with, or at least diagnosed, by analysing specific data characteristics during processing. In the end, one wants to distinguish problems over which one has no immediate control once the experiment is finished from problems that can be remedied a posteriori. A new software package, autoPROC, is also presented that combines third-party processing programs with new tools and an automated workflow script that is intended to provide users with both guidance and insight into the offline processing of data affected by the difficulties mentioned above, with particular emphasis on the automated treatment of multi-sweep data sets collected on multi-axis goniostats.},

The spectroscopic and structural effects of the two cryoprotectants glycerol and ethylene glycol on the cyan fluorescent protein Cerulean were investigated. While glycerol had almost no noticeable effect, ethylene glycol was shown to induce a systematic red shift of the UV–vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. Additionally, ethylene glycol molecules were shown to enter the core of the protein, with one of them binding in close vicinity to the chromophore, which provides a sound explanation for the observed spectroscopic changes. These results highlight the need to systematically record spectroscopic data on crystals of light-absorbing proteins and reinforce the notion that fluorescent proteins must not been seen as rigid structures.},

Here, the first structure of one of these variants, the cyan fluorescent protein mTurquoise, is presented and compared with that of its dimeric version mTurquoise-K206A. No significant structural change is detected in the chromophore cavity, reinforcing the notion that this mutation is spectroscopically silent and validating that the structural analysis performed on dimeric mutants also applies to monomeric versions. Finally, it is explained why cyan versions of GFP containing the Y66W and N146I mutations do not require the A206K mutation to prevent dimerization at high concentrations.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of proteins that are associated with their function typically occur on the microsecond timescale, orders of magnitude faster than the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy. We have recently introduced a novel approach to time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy that affords microsecond time resolution. It involves melting a cryo sample with a heating laser, so as to allow dynamics of the proteins to briefly occur in the liquid phase. When the laser is turned off, the sample rapidly revitrifies, trapping the particles in their transient configurations. Precise control of the temperature evolution of the sample is crucial for such an approach to succeed. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the heat transfer occurring under laser irradiation as well as the associated phase behavior of the cryo sample. While areas close to the laser focus undergo melting and revitrification, surrounding regions crystallize. In situ observations of these phase changes therefore provide a convenient approach for assessing the temperature reached in each melting and revitrification experiment and for adjusting the heating laser power on the fly.},

  abstract = {Phytochromes are red/far-red light photoreceptors that direct photosensory responses across the bacterial, fungal and plant kingdoms. These include photosynthetic potential and pigmentation in bacteria as well as chloroplast development and photomorphogenesis in plants. Phytochromes consist of an amino-terminal region that covalently binds a single bilin chromophore, followed by a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain that often transmits the light signal through a histidine kinase relay. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of the chromophore-binding domain of Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome assembled with its chromophore biliverdin in the Pr ground state. Our model, refined to 2.5\,Å resolution, reaffirms Cys\,24 as the chromophore attachment site, locates key amino acids that form a solvent-shielded bilin-binding pocket, and reveals an unusually formed deep trefoil knot that stabilizes this region. The structure provides the first three-dimensional glimpse into the photochromic behaviour of these photoreceptors and helps to explain the evolution of higher plant phytochromes from prokaryotic precursors.},

  abstract = {The -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH) is a multi-enzymatic complex made of three components (E1o, E2o, E3) and situated at the cross road between the Krebs cycle and nitrogen assimilation. Given its key role, this complex needs a tight regulation to coordinate carbon flux as well as energy production through the Krebs cycle. Corynebacterineae have a peculiar situation in which E2o is absent and its catalytic domain is fused to E1o; moreover, they developed a unique type of control by the FHA (Fork-Head associated, phospho-threonine recognizing) protein GarA, a sort of ‘molecular switch’ controlling glutamate synthesis and regulated by phosphorylation. When unphosphorylated, GarA binds KGD (E1o), the catalytic core of the KDH complex, inhibiting its activity. The goal of this thesis is to decipher the catalytic mechanisms of KGD, as well as the molecular basis of the inhibition by GarA. We solved the crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis KGD in complex with its cofactor thiamine diphosphate. We show for the first time that KGD undergoes large conformational rearrangements through the catalytic cycle, the major being a one-turn translocation of an external helix (E). GarA acts as an inhibitor by binding to this helix through its FHA domain, therefore preventing its translocation. However, the KGD-GarA interaction does not involve any phosphorylated threonine but a phosphate-mimicking aspartate on the E helix, an unprecedented behaviour for a FHA domain protein. The additional E2o-like domain also interacts with the same E helix, the result being a synergistic inhibitory effect. The overall inhibition of the enzyme can be relieved by acetyl-CoA, an allosteric activator that binds to a yet distinct site. The acetyl-CoA action, so far unique to the mycobacterial enzyme, is due to subtle changes in a number of residues that are crucial to the catalytic conformational change.},

  abstract = {Familiar concepts for small molecules may require reinterpretation for larger systems. For example, rearrangements between geometrical isomers are usually considered in terms of transitions between the corresponding local minima on the underlying potential energy surface, V. However, transitions between bulk phases such as solid and liquid, or between the denatured and native states of a protein, are normally addressed in terms of free energy minima. To reestablish a connection with the potential energy surface we must think in terms of representative samples of local minima of V, from which a free energy surface is projected by averaging over most of the coordinates. The present contribution outlines how this connection can be developed into a tool for quantitative calculations. In particular, stepping between the local minima of V provides powerful methods for locating the global potential energy minimum, and for calculating global thermodynamic properties. When the transition states that link local minima are also sampled we can exploit statistical rate theory to obtain insight into global dynamics and rare events. Visualizing the potential energy landscape helps to explain how the network of local minima and transition states determines properties such as heat capacity features, which signify transitions between free energy minima. The organization of the landscape also reveals how certain systems can reliably locate particular structures on the experimental time scale from among an exponentially large number of local minima. Such directed searches not only enable proteins to overcome Levinthal's paradox but may also underlie the formation of “magic numbers” in molecular beams, the self-assembly of macromolecular structures, and crystallization.},

  abstract = {Photolyases and cryptochromes form a superfamily (PCSf) of light-directed proteins found in all areas of life. Photolyases repair UV-induced DNA lesions, namely either cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPD) or pyrimidine-(6-4)-pyrimidone photoproducts, (6-4)PP. The cryptochromes have mostly lost DNA repair functionality and act as signaling proteins coupling various biological responses to light input. Photolyases and cryptochromes have close evolutionary relationships sharing both a common topology, including the same photoactive regions (FAD, antenna cofactors). During photoactivation, FAD can capture one or two electrons and exist in four possible redox states: oxidized (FADox), anionic semiquinone FAD radical (FAD•-), radical semi-reduced (semiquinone, FADH•) and fully reduced (hydroquinone, FADH-). When blue light absorption drives first electron transfer to the inactive FADox, resulting in a short-lived FAD•- which is intermediate of long-lived protonated FADH•. Furthermore, the second electron transfer leads to the fully photoactivated state, FADH-, which catalyze DNA repair of CPD or (6-4) PP by injecting an electron from excited FADH-\(\ast\) onto the DNA lesion. This study focuses on the structural changes via time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (TR-SFX) to describe how cryptochromes perform signal transduction mechanism in animal-like cryptochrome from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CraCRY). However, CraCRY is not only a cryptochrome, but also has (6-4) photolyase function, meaning (6-4) PP repair. In CraCRY, during first light-driven cycle, three tryptophans and one tyrosine (Y373) act as an electron transfer chain, with Y373 donating the electron to the FAD to produce short-lived radical pair (RP) FAD•-/Y373•+, which evolves to the long-lived FADH•/Y373• RP. The tyrosyl radical is triggering a structural change in the region between the loop carrying the tyrosyl radical and the C-terminal α22- helix, and c-terminal unfolding afterwards. In the photoreduction of CraCRY, 19 snapshot structures were obtained, which showed that signal transduction occurred in three different phases in ns to ms: (1) stabilization of FAD•- and Tyr•+ radicals (ns), (2) stabilization of FAD•- via proton transfer (μs to ms), and (3) c-terminal unfolding (ms to s). These results demonstrated a detailed molecular mechanism for cryptochrome photoactivation. For (6-4) PP repair, we success to preliminarily characterize via in crystallo cryo-trapping of post-illumination intermediates, immediately followed by data collection. we were able to determine three stages of complex dissociation at atomic resolution: (1) base relaxation within the active site, (2) base return towards the unpaired bubble and (3) DNA release from the (6-4)-photolyase active site. For further investigation of photoreduction, mutant analysis of each relevant actor in the signaling state were characterized both spectroscopically and crystallographically. The mutation influenced the formation of the signaling state characterizing the role of individual amino-acids during the CraCRY photocycle. For repairing DNA lesion, (6-4) PP repair mechanism is still not clear. Future TR-SFX experiments will show the whole repair mechanism for (6-4) PP repair},

  abstract = {While protein conformational heterogeneity plays an important role in many aspects of biological function, including ligand binding, its impact has been difficult to quantify. Macromolecular X-ray diffraction is commonly interpreted with a static structure, but it can provide information on both the anharmonic and harmonic contributions to conformational heterogeneity. Here, through multiconformer modeling of time- and space-averaged electron density, we measure conformational heterogeneity of 743 stringently matched pairs of crystallographic datasets that reflect unbound/apo and ligand-bound/holo states. When comparing the conformational heterogeneity of side chains, we observe that when binding site residues become more rigid upon ligand binding, distant residues tend to become more flexible, especially in non-solvent exposed regions. Among ligand properties, we observe increased protein flexibility as the number of hydrogen bonds decrease and relative hydrophobicity increases. Across a series of 13 inhibitor bound structures of CDK2, we find that conformational heterogeneity is correlated with inhibitor features and identify how conformational changes propagate differences in conformational heterogeneity away from the binding site. Collectively, our findings agree with models emerging from NMR studies suggesting that residual side chain entropy can modulate affinity and point to the need to integrate both static conformational changes and conformational heterogeneity in models of ligand binding.},

It usually is presumed to be nonspecific and manifested as a gradual decay in the overall quality of data obtained for a given crystal as data collection proceeds. Based on third-generation synchrotron x-ray data, collected at cryogenic temperatures, we show for the enzymes Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase and hen egg white lysozyme that synchrotron radiation also can cause highly specific damage. Disulfide bridges break, and carboxyl groups of acidic residues lose their definition. Highly exposed carboxyls, and those in the active site of both enzymes, appear particularly susceptible. The catalytic triad residue, His-440, in acetylcholinesterase, also appears to be much more sensitive to radiation damage than other histidine residues. Our findings have direct practical implications for routine x-ray data collection at high-energy synchrotron sources. Furthermore, they provide a direct approach for studying the radiation chemistry of proteins and nucleic acids at a detailed, structural level and also may yield information concerning putative “weak links” in a given biological macromolecule, which may be of structural and functional significance.},

In 2007, Dong et al reported that the addition of trace amounts of protease to crystallization trials—in situ proteolysis—significantly increased the number of proteins in a given set that produce diffraction quality crystals. 69 proteins that had previously resisted structure determination were subjected to crystallization with in situ proteolysis and ten crystallized in a form that led to structure determination (14.5\% success rate). Here we apply in situ proteolysis to over 270 new soluble proteins that had failed in the past to produce crystals suitable for structure determination. These proteins had produced no crystals, crystals that diffracted poorly, or produced twinned and/or unmanageable diffraction data. The new set includes yeast and prokaryotic proteins, enzymes essential to protozoan parasites, and human proteins such as GTPases, chromatin remodeling proteins, and tyrosine kinases. 34 proteins yielded deposited crystal structures of 2.8 Å resolution or better, for an overall 12.6\% success rate, and at least ten more yielded well-diffracting crystals presently in refinement. The success rate among proteins that had previously crystallized was double that of those that had never before yielded crystals. The overall success rate is similar to that observed in the smaller study, and appears to be higher than any other method reported to rescue stalled protein crystallography projects.},

  abstract = {Proteins are dynamic objects and undergo conformational changes when functioning. These changes range from interconversion between states in equilibrium to ultrafast and coherent structural motions within one perturbed state. Time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography at free-electron X-ray lasers can unravel structural changes with atomic resolution and down to femtosecond time scales. In this review, we summarize recent advances on detecting structural changes for phytochrome photosensor proteins and a bacterial photosynthetic reaction center. In the phytochrome structural changes are extensive and involve major rearrangements of many amino acids and water molecules, accompanying the regulation of its biochemical activity, whereas in the photosynthetic reaction center protein the structural changes are smaller, more localized, and are optimized to facilitate electron transfer along the chromophores. The detected structural motions underpin the proteins’ function, providing a showcase for the importance of detecting ultrafast protein structural dynamics.},

The constituent programs deal with viewing, indexing, integrating, merging and evaluating the quality of the data, and also simulating patterns. The specific challenges addressed chiefly concern the indexing and integration of large numbers of diffraction patterns in an automated manner, and so the software is designed to be fast and to make use of multi-core hardware. Other constituent programs deal with the merging and scaling of large numbers of intensities from randomly oriented snapshot diffraction patterns. The suite uses a generalized representation of a detector to ease the use of more complicated geometries than those familiar in conventional crystallography.

  abstract = {Background Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is the simplest known light driven proton pump and has been heavily studied using structural methods: eighty four X-ray diffraction, six electron diffraction and three NMR structures of bR are deposited within the protein data bank. Twenty one X-ray structures report light induced structural changes and changes induced by mutation, changes in pH, thermal annealing or X-ray induced photo-reduction have also been examined. Scope of review We argue that light-induced structural changes that are replicated across several studies by independent research groups are those most likely to represent what is happening in reality. We present both internal distance matrix analyses that sort deposited bR structures into hierarchal trees, and difference Fourier analysis of deposited X-ray diffraction data. Major conclusions An internal distance matrix analysis separates most wild-type bR structures according to their different crystal forms, indicating how the protein's structure is influenced by crystallization conditions. A similar analysis clusters eleven studies of illuminated bR crystals as one branch of a hierarchal tree with reproducible movements of the extracellular portion of helix C towards helix G, and of the cytoplasmic portion of helix F away from helices A, B and G. All crystallographic data deposited for illuminated crystals show negative difference density on a water molecule (Wat402) that forms H-bonds to the retinal Schiff Base and two aspartate residues (Asp85, Asp212) in the bR resting state. Other recurring difference density features indicated reproducible side-chain, backbone and water molecule displacements. X-ray induced radiation damage also disorders Wat402 but acts via cleaving the head-groups of Asp85 and Asp212. General significance A remarkable level of agreement exists when deposited structures and crystallographic observations are viewed as a whole. From this agreement a unified picture of the structural mechanism of light-induced proton pumping by bR emerges.

  abstract = {Time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) at an x-ray free electron laser enables protein structural changes to be imaged on time-scales from femtoseconds to seconds. It can, however, be difficult to grasp the nature and timescale of global protein motions when structural changes are not isolated near a single active site. New tools are, therefore, needed to represent the global nature of electron density changes and their correlation with modeled protein structural changes. Here, we use TR-SFX data from bacteriorhodopsin to develop and validate a method for quantifying time-dependent electron density changes and correlating them throughout the protein. We define a spherical volume of difference electron density about selected atoms, average separately the positive and negative electron difference densities within each volume, and walk this spherical volume through all atoms within the protein. By correlating the resulting difference electron density amplitudes with time, our approach facilitates an initial assessment of the number and timescale of structural intermediates and highlights quake-like motions on the sub-picosecond timescale. This tool also allows structural models to be compared with experimental data using theoretical difference electron density changes calculated from refined resting and photo-activated structures.},

With an excitation maximum at 559 nm and an emission maximum at 611 nm, the recombinant protein shows the most red-shifted emission and the largest Stokes shift of all nonmodified proteins in the green fluorescent protein family. The protein fluoresces with a high quantum yield of 0.45, although it resembles the nonfluorescent members of this protein class, as inferred from the absence of the key amino acid serine at position 143. Fluorescence is constant within the range pH 4–10. Red fluorophore maturation reaches a level of 90\% after ≈12 h by passing through a green intermediate. After complete maturation, only a small fraction of the green species (less than 1\%) persists. The protein has a reduced tendency to oligomerize, as shown by its monomeric appearance in SDS/PAGE analysis and single-molecule experiments. However, it forms tetramers at higher concentrations in the absence of detergent. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy reveals light-driven transitions between bright and dark states on submillisecond and millisecond time scales. Applicability of eqFP611 for in vivo labeling in eukaryotic systems was shown by expression in a mammalian cell culture.},

However, to date, it has been unclear whether it would indeed be possible to measure high-quality diffraction data at megahertz pulse repetition rates. Here, we show that high-quality structures can indeed be obtained using currently available operating conditions at the European XFEL. We present two complete data sets, one from the well-known model system lysozyme and the other from a so far unknown complex of a β-lactamase from K. pneumoniae involved in antibiotic resistance. This result opens up megahertz serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) as a tool for reliable structure determination, substrate screening and the efficient measurement of the evolution and dynamics of molecular structures using megahertz repetition rate pulses available at this new class of X-ray laser source.},

The observed characteristic frequency shifts were reproduced in quantum-mechanical models of the flavin binding site, which were then employed to elucidate redox tuning governed by Asn378. We demonstrate that enhanced hydrogen bonding of the Asn378 side chain with the FADH• radical increases thermodynamic stabilization of the radical state, and further ensures kinetic stabilization and accumulation of the fully reduced FADH– state.},

Two metal ions bind to the active site, followed by binding of moxalactam and the intact β-lactam ring is observed for 100\,ms after photolysis. Cleavage of β-lactam is detected at 150\,ms and the ligand is significantly displaced. The reaction product adjusts its conformation reaching steady state at 2000 ms corresponding to the relaxed state of the enzyme.

Time-resolved serial crystallography methods at synchrotron and X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) sources have enabled researchers to follow enzyme catalysis and other nonequilibrium events at ambient conditions with unprecedented time resolution. X-ray crystallography provides detailed information about conformational heterogeneity and protein dynamics, which is enhanced when time-resolved approaches are used. This review outlines the ways in which information about the underlying energy landscape of a protein can be extracted from X-ray crystallographic data, with an emphasis on new developments in XFEL and synchrotron time-resolved crystallography. The emerging view of enzyme catalysis afforded by these techniques can be interpreted as enzymes moving on a time-dependent energy landscape. Some consequences of this view are discussed, including the proposal that irreversible enzymes or enzymes that use covalent catalytic mechanisms may commonly exhibit catalysis-activated motions.},

Here, we report on the functional, spectral and structural characteristics of the peculiar Planktothrix PCC7805 OCP (Plankto-OCP). We show that this OCP variant is characterized by higher photoactivation and recovery rates, and a stronger energy-quenching activity, compared to other OCP studied thus far. We characterize the effect of the functionalizing carotenoid and of his-tagging on these reactions, and identify the time scales on which these modifications affect photoactivation. The presence of a his-tag at the C-terminus has a large influence on photoactivation, thermal recovery and PBS-fluorescence quenching, and likewise for the nature of the carotenoid that additionally affects the yield and characteristics of excited states and the ns-s dynamics of photoactivated OCP. By solving the structures of Plankto-OCP in the ECN- and CAN-functionalized states, each in two closely-related crystal forms, we further unveil the molecular breathing motions that animate Plankto-OCP at the monomer and dimer levels. We finally discuss the structural changes that could explain the peculiar properties of Plankto-OCP.},

  abstract = {The CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4) software suite is a collection of programs and associated data and software libraries which can be used for macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography. The suite is designed to be flexible, allowing users a number of methods of~achieving their aims. The programs are from a wide variety of~sources but are connected by a common infrastructure provided by standard file formats, data objects and graphical interfaces. Structure solution by macromolecular crystallography is becoming increasingly automated and the CCP4 suite includes several automation pipelines. After giving a brief description of the evolution of CCP4 over the last 30 years, an overview of the current suite is given. While detailed descriptions are given in the accompanying articles, here it is shown how the individual programs contribute to a complete software package.},

Room temperature X-ray data collection is emerging as a key variable for sampling functionally relevant conformations also observed in solution studies. Although concerns about radiation damage are warranted with higher temperature data collection, ‘diffract and destroy’ strategies on X-ray free electron lasers may permit radiation damage-free data collection.

Photoswitching from a non-fluorescent off-state to a fluorescent on-state involves trans-to-cis chromophore isomerization and proton transfer. Whereas excited-state events on the ps timescale have been structurally characterized, conformational changes on slower timescales remain elusive. Here we describe the off-to-on photoswitching mechanism in the RSFP rsEGFP2 by using a combination of time-resolved serial crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser and ns-resolved pump–probe UV-visible spectroscopy. Ten ns after photoexcitation, the crystal structure features a chromophore that isomerized from trans to cis but the surrounding pocket features conformational differences compared to the final on-state. Spectroscopy identifies the chromophore in this ground-state photo-intermediate as being protonated. Deprotonation then occurs on the μs timescale and correlates with a conformational change of the conserved neighbouring histidine. Together with a previous excited-state study, our data allow establishing a detailed mechanism of off-to-on photoswitching in rsEGFP2.},

Defining the three-dimensional structures of iron enzymes in resting, oxy-bound intermediate and substrate-bound states is particularly challenging, not least because of the extreme susceptibility of the Fe(III) and Fe(IV) redox states to radiation-induced chemistry caused by intense X-ray or electron beams. The availability of novel sources such as X-ray free electron lasers has enabled structures that are effectively free of the effects of radiation-induced chemistry and allows time-resolved structures to be determined. Important to both applications is the ability to obtain in crystallo spectroscopic data to identify the redox state of the iron in any particular structure or timepoint.},

Photopharmacology introduces chemical triggers that allow the changing of ligand affinities and thus biological activity by light. Insight into the molecular mechanisms of photopharmacology is largely missing because the relevant transitions during the light-triggered reaction cannot be resolved by conventional structural biology. Using time-resolved serial crystallography at a synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser, we capture the release of the anti-cancer compound azo-combretastatin A4 and the resulting conformational changes in tubulin. Nine structural snapshots from 1\,ns to 100\,ms complemented by simulations show how cis-to-trans isomerization of the azobenzene bond leads to a switch in ligand affinity, opening of an exit channel, and collapse of the binding pocket upon ligand release. The resulting global backbone rearrangements are related to the action mechanism of microtubule-destabilizing drugs.},

The enzymatic reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we carefully characterized its dynamic evolution with femtosecond spectroscopy. We observed initial electron transfer from the substrate to the flavin cofactor in 347 ps with a stretched dynamic behavior and subsequently captured the critical carbonyloxy radical. The dominant process following this step was decarboxylation in 5.8 ns to form an alkyl radical and a carbon dioxide molecule. We further identified the absorption bands of two carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates. The overall enzymatic quantum efficiency determined by our obtained timescales is 0.81, consistent with the steady-state value. The results are essential to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism and catalytic photocycle, providing a molecular basis for potential design of flavin-based artificial photoenzymes.},

  abstract = {To gain insight into crystalline protein dynamics, we performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of a periodic 2\,×\,2\,×\,2 supercell of staphylococcal nuclease. We used the resulting MD trajectories to simulate X-ray diffraction and to study collective motions. The agreement of simulated X-ray diffraction with the data is comparable to previous MD simulation studies. We studied collective motions by analyzing statistically the covariance of alpha-carbon position displacements. The covariance decreases exponentially with the distance between atoms, which is consistent with a liquidlike motions (LLM) model, in which the protein behaves like a soft material. To gain finer insight into the collective motions, we examined the covariance behavior within a protein molecule (intraprotein) and between different protein molecules (interprotein). The interprotein atom pairs, which dominate the overall statistics, exhibit LLM behavior; however, the intraprotein pairs exhibit behavior that is consistent with a superposition of LLM and rigid-body motions (RBM). Our results indicate that LLM behavior of global dynamics is present in MD simulations of a protein crystal. They also show that RBM behavior is detectable in the simulations but that it is subsumed by the LLM behavior. Finally, the results provide clues about how correlated motions of atom pairs both within and across proteins might manifest in diffraction data. Overall, our findings increase our understanding of the connection between molecular motions and diffraction data and therefore advance efforts to extract information about functionally important motions from crystallography experiments.},

  abstract = {Photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is a eubacterial photoreceptor and a structural prototype of the PAS domain superfamily of receptor and regulatory proteins. We investigate the activation mechanism of PYP using time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Our data provide structural, kinetic, and energetic evidence that the putative signaling state of PYP is formed during a large-amplitude protein quake that is driven by the formation of a new buried charge, COO- of the conserved Glu46, in a highly hydrophobic pocket at the active site. A protein quake is a process consisting of global conformational changes that are triggered and driven by a local structural “fault”. We show that large, global structural changes take place after Glu46 ionization via intramolecular proton transfer to the anionic p-coumarate chromophore, and are suppressed by the absence of COO- formation in the E46Q mutant. Our results demonstrate the significance of buried charge formation in photoreceptor activation. This mechanism may serve as one of the general themes in activation of a range of receptor proteins. In addition, we report the results of time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy of PYP crystals. The direct comparison of time-resolved FTIR spectroscopic data of PYP in aqueous solution and in crystals reveals that the structure of the putative signaling state is not developed in P63 crystals. Therefore, when the structural developments during the functional process of a protein are experimentally determined to be very different in crystals and solutions, one must be cautious in drawing conclusions regarding the functional mechanism of proteins based on time-resolved X-ray crystallography.},

  abstract = {Photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is a photoreceptor containing a unique 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (pCA) chromophore. The trans to cis photoisomerization of this chromophore activates a photocycle involving first a short-lived red-shifted intermediate (pR), then a long-lived blue-shifted intermediate (pB), and finally recovery of the original receptor state (pG). The pCA chromophore is deprotonated in pG and protonated in pB, but the proton donor for this process has not yet been identified. Here we report the first FTIR spectroscopic data on pG, pR, and pB. The IR difference signals in the carbonyl stretching region of COOH groups (1700-1800 cm-1) reveal that a buried carboxylic group close to the chromophore (i) is protonated in pG, (ii) develops a stronger hydrogen bonding in pR, and (iii) becomes deprotonated in pB. These signals are unambiguously assigned to Glu46, on the basis of the IR data and the 1.4 Å X-ray structure of PYP [Borgstahl et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6278-6287]. Our data demonstrate that in pR Glu46 remains in hydrogen bonding contact with the negatively charged phenolic oxygen of pCA after chromophore photoisomerization. This strongly implies that the chromophore is isomerized to the 7-cis 9-s-trans conformation in pR, resulting from co-isomerization of both the C7C8 and C9C10 bonds. In the pR to pB transition, Glu46 becomes deprotonated, concomitant with chromophore protonation. Therefore, we conclude that Glu46 functions as the proton donor for the protonation of pCA during the PYP photocycle. We propose a molecular mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer in PYP leads to global protein conformational changes involved in signal transduction.},

  abstract = {Night-migratory songbirds are remarkably proficient navigators1. Flying alone and often over great distances, they use various directional cues including, crucially, a light-dependent magnetic compass2,3. The mechanism of this compass has been suggested to rely on the quantum spin dynamics of photoinduced radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins located in the retinas of the birds4–7. Here we show that the photochemistry of cryptochrome 4 (CRY4) from the night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula) is magnetically sensitive in vitro, and more so than CRY4 from two non-migratory bird species, chicken (Gallus gallus) and pigeon (Columba livia). Site-specific mutations of ErCRY4 reveal the roles of four successive flavin–tryptophan radical pairs in generating magnetic field effects and in stabilizing potential signalling states in a way that could enable sensing and signalling functions to be independently optimized in night-migratory birds.},

In the CCP4 suite this chemical knowledge is stored in a Monomer Library, which comprises a set of restraint dictionaries. To use restraints in refinement, the model is analysed and template restraints from the dictionary are used to infer (i) restraints between concrete atoms and (ii) the positions of riding hydrogen atoms. Recently, this mundane process has been overhauled. This was also an opportunity to enhance the Monomer Library with new features, resulting in a small improvement in REFMAC5 refinement. Importantly, the overhaul of this part of CCP4 has increased flexibility and eased experimentation, opening up new possibilities.},

  abstract = {In protein microcrystallography, radiation damage often hampers complete and high-resolution data collection from a single crystal, even under cryogenic conditions. One promising solution is to collect small wedges of data (5–10°) separately from multiple crystals. The data from these crystals can then be merged into a complete reflection-intensity set. However, data processing of multiple small-wedge data sets is challenging. Here, a new open-source data-processing pipeline, KAMO, which utilizes existing programs, including the XDS and CCP4 packages, has been developed to automate whole data-processing tasks in the case of multiple small-wedge data sets. Firstly, KAMO processes individual data sets and collates those indexed with equivalent unit-cell parameters. The space group is then chosen and any indexing ambiguity is resolved. Finally, clustering is performed, followed by merging with outlier rejections, and a report is subsequently created. Using synthetic and several real-world data sets collected from hundreds of crystals, it was demonstrated that merged structure-factor amplitudes can be obtained in a largely automated manner using KAMO, which greatly facilitated the structure analyses of challenging targets that only produced microcrystals.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in X-ray detector technology have resulted in the introduction of segmented detectors composed of many small detector modules tiled together to cover a large detection area. Due to mechanical tolerances and the desire to be able to change the module layout to suit the needs of different experiments, the pixels on each module might not align perfectly on a regular grid. Several detectors are designed to permit detector sub-regions (or modules) to be moved relative to each other for different experiments. Accurate determination of the location of detector elements relative to the beam-sample interaction point is critical for many types of experiment, including X-ray crystallography, coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and spectroscopy. For detectors with moveable modules, the relative positions of pixels are no longer fixed, necessitating the development of a simple procedure to calibrate detector geometry after reconfiguration. We describe a simple and robust method for determining the geometry of segmented X-ray detectors using measurements obtained by serial crystallography. By comparing the location of observed Bragg peaks to the spot locations predicted from the crystal indexing procedure, the position, rotation and distance of each module relative to the interaction region can be refined. We show that the refined detector geometry greatly improves the results of experiments.},

X-ray pulses captured structural changes in ClR upon flash illumination with a 550 nm fs-pumping laser. High-resolution structures for five time points (dark to 100 ps after flashing) reveal complex and coordinated dynamics comprising retinal isomerization, water molecule rearrangement, and conformational changes of various residues. Combining data from time-resolved spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, this study reveals that the chloride ion close to the Schiff base undergoes a dissociation–diffusion process upon light-triggered retinal isomerization.},

  abstract = {Many biological mechanisms rely on the precise control of conformational changes in proteins. Understanding such dynamic processes requires methods for determining structures and their temporal evolution. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to time-resolved ion mobility mass spectrometry. We validated the method on a simple photoreceptor model and applied it to a more complex system, the animal-like cryptochrome from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CraCRY), to determine the role of specific amino acids affecting the conformational dynamics as reaction to blue light activation. In our setup, using a high-power LED mounted in the source region of an ion mobility mass spectrometer, we allow a time-resolved evaluation of mass and ion mobility spectra. Cryptochromes like CraCRY are a widespread type of blue light photoreceptors and mediate various light-triggered biological functions upon excitation of their inbuilt flavin chromophore. Another hallmark of cryptochromes is their flexible carboxy-terminal extension (CTE), whose structure and function as well as the details of its interaction with the photolyase homology region are not yet fully understood and differ among different cryptochromes types. Here, we addressed the highly conserved C-terminal domain of CraCRY, to study the effects of single mutations on the structural transition of the C-terminal helix α22 and the attached CTE upon lit-state formation. We show that D321, the putative proton acceptor of the terminal proton-coupled electron transfer event from Y373, is essential for triggering the large-scale conformational changes of helix α22 and the CTE in the lit state, while D323 influences the timing.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of light-triggered conformational change and signaling in light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains remains elusive in spite of extensive investigation and their use in optogenetic studies. The LOV2 domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV2), a member of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) family, contains a flavin mononucleotide chromophore that forms a covalent bond with a cysteine upon illumination. This event leads to the release of the carboxy-terminal Jα helix, the biological output signal. Using mutational analysis, circular dichroism, and NMR, we find that the largely ignored amino-terminal helix is a control element in AsLOV2's light-activated conformational change.

These findings provide a framework to rationalize the LOV domain architecture, as well as the signaling mechanisms in both isolated and tandem arrangements of PAS domains.

  abstract = {Algae, plants, bacteria, and fungi contain flavin-binding light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains that function as blue light sensors to control cellular responses to light. In the second LOV domain of phototropins, called LOV2 domains, blue light illumination leads to covalent bond formation between protein and flavin that induces the dissociation and unfolding of a C-terminally attached α helix (Jα) and the N-terminal helix (A′α). To date, the majority of studies on these domains have focused on versions that contain truncations in the termini, which creates difficulties when extrapolating to the much larger proteins that contain these domains. Here, we study the influence of deletions and extensions of the A′α helix of the LOV2 domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV2) on the light-triggered structural response of the protein by Fourier-transform infrared difference spectroscopy. Deletion of the A′α helix abolishes the light-induced unfolding of Jα, whereas extensions of the A′α helix lead to an attenuated structural change of Jα. These results are different from shorter constructs, indicating that the conformational changes in full-length phototropin LOV domains might not be as large as previously assumed, and that the well-characterized full unfolding of the Jα helix in AsLOV2 with short A′α helices may be considered a truncation artifact. It also suggests that the N- and C-terminal helices of phot-LOV2 domains are necessary for allosteric regulation of the phototropin kinase domain and may provide a basis for signal integration of LOV1 and LOV2 domains in phototropins.},

The FAD cofactor, conserved in the whole protein superfamily of photolyase/cryptochromes, adopts a unique folded configuration at the active site that plays a critical functional role in DNA repair. Here, we review our comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of flavin cofactor and its repair photocycles by different classes of photolyases on the most fundamental level. Using femtosecond spectroscopy and molecular biology, significant advances have recently been made to map out the entire dynamical evolution and determine actual timescales of all the catalytic processes in photolyases. The repair of CPD reveals seven electron-transfer (ET) reactions among ten elementary steps by a cyclic ET radical mechanism through bifurcating ET pathways, a direct tunneling route mediated by the intervening adenine and a two-step hopping path bridged by the intermediate adenine from the cofactor to damaged DNA, through the conserved folded flavin at the active site. The unified, bifurcated ET mechanism elucidates the molecular origin of various repair quantum yields of different photolyases from three life kingdoms. For 6-4 photoproduct repair, a similar cyclic ET mechanism operates and a new cyclic proton transfer with a conserved histidine residue at the active site of (6-4) photolyases is revealed.},

POR, which is one of three known light-dependent enzymes4,5, catalyses reduction of the photosensitizer and substrate protochlorophyllide to form the pigment chlorophyllide. Despite its biological importance, the structural basis for POR photocatalysis has remained unknown. Here we report crystal structures of cyanobacterial PORs from Thermosynechococcus elongatus and Synechocystis sp. in their free forms, and in complex with the nicotinamide~coenzyme. Our structural models and simulations of the ternary protochlorophyllide–NADPH–POR complex identify multiple interactions in the POR active site that are important for protochlorophyllide binding, photosensitization and photochemical conversion to chlorophyllide. We demonstrate the importance of active-site architecture and protochlorophyllide structure in driving POR photochemistry in experiments using POR variants and protochlorophyllide analogues. These studies reveal how the POR active site facilitates light-driven reduction of protochlorophyllide by localized hydride transfer from NADPH and long-range proton transfer along structurally defined proton-transfer pathways.},

  abstract = {Crystallography has made a notable contribution to our knowledge of structural biology. For traditional crystallography experiments, the growth of crystals with large size and high quality is crucial, and it remains one of the bottlenecks. In recent years, the successful application of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) provides a new choice when only numerous microcrystals can be obtained. The intense pulsed radiation of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) enables the data collection of small-sized crystals, making the size of crystals no longer a limiting factor. The ultrafast pulses of XFELs can achieve ‘diffraction before destruction’, which effectively avoids radiation damage and realizes diffraction near physiological temperatures. More recently, the SFX has been expanded to serial crystallography (SX) that can additionally employ synchrotron radiation as the light source. In addition to the traditional ones, these techniques provide complementary opportunities for structural determination. The development of SX experiments strongly relies on the advancement of hardware including the sample delivery system, the X-ray source, and the X-ray detector. Here, in this review, we categorize the existing sample delivery systems, summarize their progress, and propose their future prospectives.},

  abstract = {An investigation of the internal flow field for a drop at the antinode of a standing wave has been carried out. The main difference from the solid sphere case is the inclusion of the shear stress and velocity continuity conditions at the liquid–gas interface. To the leading order of calculation, the internal flow field was found to be quite weak. Also, this order being fully time dependent has a zero mean flow. At the next higher order, steady internal flows are predicted and, as in the case of a solid sphere, there is a recirculating layer consisting of closed streamlines near the surface. In the case of a liquid drop, however, the behavior of this recirculating Stokes layer is quite interesting. It is predicted that the layer ceases to have recirculation when |M|\&gt;522[2+5(μ̂/μ)], where μ̂ is the liquid viscosity, μ is the exterior gas-phase viscosity, and M is the dimensionless frequency parameter for the gas phase, defined by M=iωa2ρ/μ, with a being the drop radius. Thorough experimental confirmation of this interesting new development needs to be conducted. Although it seems to agree with many experiments with levitated drops where no recirculating layer has been clearly observed, a new set of experiments for specifically testing this interesting development need to be carried out.},

  abstract = {Flavins are highly versatile redox-active and colored cofactors in a large variety of proteins. These do include photoenzymes and photoreceptors, although the vast majority performs non-light-driven physiological functions. Nevertheless, electron transfer between flavins and specific nearby amino acid residues (in particular tyrosine, tryptophan, and presumably histidine and arginine) takes place upon excitation of flavin in many flavoproteins. For oxidized flavoproteins these reactions potentially have a photoprotective role. In this Perspective, we outline work on the characterization of early reaction intermediates not only in the relatively well-studied resting oxidized forms but also in the fully reduced and the intrinsically unstable semireduced forms, where ultrafast photooxidation of flavin was recently demonstrated. Along different lines, flavoprotein-based novel photocatalysts for biotechnological applications are presently emerging, employing both substrate photooxidation and photoreduction strategies. Deep insight into the fundamental flavin photochemical reactions may help in guiding and optimizing their development and in the exploration of novel photocatalytic approaches.},

The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of C. reinhardtii, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of C. reinhardtii: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.},

Here we compare time-resolved serial crystallographic data of the bacteriorhodopsin K-intermediate collected at laser power densities ranging from 0.04 to 2493\,GW/cm2 and follow energy dissipation of the absorbed photons logarithmically from picoseconds to milliseconds.

  abstract = {Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) are key players in advanced microscopy schemes such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM). Whereas photoconversion and red-state blinking in PCFPs have been studied intensively, their green-state photophysical behavior has received less attention. Yet dark states in green PCFPs can become strongly populated in PALM schemes and exert an indirect but considerable influence on the quality of data recorded in the red channel. Furthermore, green-state photoswitching in PCFPs can be used directly for PALM and has been engineered to design highly efficient reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) amenable to various nanoscopy schemes. Here, we demonstrate that green mEos4b efficiently switches to a long-lived dark state through cis--trans isomerization of its chromophore, as do most RSFPs. However, by combining kinetic crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and Raman spectroscopy, we find that the dark state in green mEos4b is much more dynamic than that seen in switched-off green IrisFP, a biphotochromic PCFP engineered from the common EosFP parent. Our data suggest that H-bonding patterns maintained by the chromophore in green PCFPs and RSFPs in both their on- and off-states collectively control photoswitching quantum yields. The reduced number of H-bonds maintained by the dynamic dark chromophore in green mEos4b thus largely accounts for the observed lower switching contrast as compared to that of IrisFP. We also compare the long-lived dark states reached from green and red mEos4b, on the basis of their X-ray structures and Raman signatures. Altogether, these data provide a unifying picture of the complex photophysics of PCFPs and RSFPs.},
